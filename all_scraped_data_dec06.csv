                                This curriculum was designed for a junior level US History course. Students are asked to identify a news article that highlights an important aspect of the COVID-19 experience. Students are also asked to write a summary of the article that includes an overview of the article, why they selected the article, the importance of the article, what the article reveals about life during COVID-19, identification of any noticeable bias in the article, and a statement about the responsibility of the media during the pandemic. The curriculum and student work are being submitted to the JOTPY archive to provide insight into the topics that are important to teenagers, as well as the expectations and reality of the media during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also give insight into the vast array of perspectives teenagers living during the COVID-19 pandemic have based on the diversity of their current life experiences.

                                Claire Cunliffe, a high school mathematics teacher from Baltimore, Maryland, compares the early implementation of distance learning procedures among public and private school districts. While Claire reflects on the positive response to distance learning among students at private schools, including the increased ability for students to self-pace, she expresses concern over the lack of funding and limited resources available for students attending public schools. Claire makes the argument that technological unavailability among minority populations is exacerbating the opportunity gap among urban students. Reflecting on the conflicting responses of city and state leaders, including Governor Larry Hogan, Claire offers suggestions for reopening schools that ultimately place the decision in the hands of parents and healthcare professionals, instead of politicians. Claire conveys optimism that distance learning practices during the COVID-19 pandemic will permanently reshape the educational sector by encouraging interactive approaches to teaching, promoting community building among students, and displaying the benefits of incorporating digital elements into the classroom curriculum.",,,,,

                                When I first began the Journal of the Plague Year internship, I wasn‚Äôt completely sure what to expect.  I wanted to be part of something impactful and important during the pandemic and was hoping to learn some new skills that could be applied in furthering my academic studies or in future job pursuits.  What I discovered as the internship went on is that I was going to get to do all of that and so much more.  What I thought was going to be a ‚Äústandard‚Äù internship was instead a fast-paced, jump in with both feet without looking, rollercoaster ride.  I had no previous experience doing public history work beyond conducting an oral history interview with my great-grandmother for an ‚ÄúAging in Rural America‚Äù course during my undergraduate studies.  What I discovered was the entire behind the scenes effort that makes these pieces of information readily accessible to the public.  As the internship progressed, not only was I adjusting to constantly changing best practice regarding curation, but I was also learning new skills that I would have likely not learned anywhere else in my academic career.  What started, in my mind, as a simple internship turned into one of the greatest learning experiences of my academic career, to date.

	Never had I imagined that I would learn, let alone use, some of the skills that were cultivated during this internship.  While I am not a fan of the redaction portion of public history, likely because I don‚Äôt feel very adept at it, many of the other skills introduced and learned during this internship appealed to me greatly.  During the blog post writing assignment, I discovered the challenge of attempting to write an attention-grabbing piece that was interesting to read to a general audience yet informational enough to convey the necessary information while maintaining a condensed length so as not to lose a reader‚Äôs interest.  This was extremely challenging for me as I tend to be long-winded and include to much ‚Äúfluff‚Äù in much of my writing.  I, however, found the challenge enjoying and plan to continue to hone my blogging skills; maybe even someday start my own history related blog.  One of the most enjoyable skills that I learned was the entire range of conducting and polishing an oral history.  The development of questions, the interview itself, the transcription (the first few attempts were very rough), and even the cataloging and archiving of the history were a joy once I understood and was comfortable with the process.  Finding new tools to use as part of the oral history portion of the internship such as otter.ai was also an extremely rewarding aspect of the process.  This skill will likely prove itself especially useful in my further academic and professional pursuits.

	Finally, the experience of interaction between the interns was unique in my experiences working with others.  Never have I participated in an entirely digital project or team experience before the JOTPY internship.  The experience was unique and very rewarding, and the interaction between the interns was exceptional.  Not only did we conduct weekly meetings regarding the archive and internship and work remotely within groups using digital tools within the internship group, but we connected, interacted, and worked with other groups and individuals associated with the archive using the same tools (Zoom, Slack, etc.)  I have had some of my fellow interns in other classes during my program, but being able to actively see, speak, and work with my colleagues was a wonderful experience and I was lucky to be part of such a great group of historians.",,,,,

Many didn't like this, and they surely weren't going to follow the rules until they started to be closed down left and right by the health department, then suddenly everyone shaped up.",,,,,

                                The National Council of Jewish Women of Australia Victoria (NCJWA Vic) was established 93‚ÄØyears‚ÄØago with the vision of creating a better world for women.‚ÄØOur‚ÄØmission, is to support women at key points‚ÄØacross the life cycle,‚ÄØadvance their‚ÄØstatus‚ÄØand‚ÄØpromote social cohesion and human rights.

NCJWA Vic rolled into crisis management determined to continue our mission to support women and girls during this difficult time. Strong and decisive action was taken to keep our people safe and continue serving our community. We quickly adapted most of our program, while participants were incredibly grateful for our continued support, illuminating the need and value of social connection for mental wellbeing throughout our lives, even more so during such a crisis.

                                Moab Utah is a lively tourist town normally filled with visitors from around the world. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it a ghost town.            
                                
                                Story, self written            
                                
                                Moab Utah is a lively tourist town normally filled with visitors from around the globe. Each year as the spring blooms, the town‚Äôs population goes from 8000 to nearly 100,000 people. They visit to see the world renown landscapes, participate in extreme sports, hike in two National Parks, and join in a variety of events focused on recreational activities. The town survives on the tourist industry and it has been starved with the COVID-19 pandemic. 

	Each year during the week of Easter, Moab hosts the Moab Jeep Safari where thousands of 4x4 enthusiasts gather to not only test their abilities on some of the most extreme trails, but also connect with others, see the new gear and enjoy landscape. Due to COVID-19, the Moab Jeep Safari was cancelled for the first time in 53 years. Instead of hearing the sounds engines revving, horns honking and the commotion of the crowds, Moab was silent. Instead of seeing traffic jams compared those of large cities, there were empty streets. This unnerving silence left the locals feeling uneasy and frightened, as this silence was more from a post-apoplectic scene rather than a quiet rural town. The silence made it seem that we were alone, no longer connected to the wide world. The silence meant there was an absence of enjoyment, accomplishment and celebration. The silence took away the hopes for the next day, the next week, the next month and maybe more. 

	The absence of people and the silence changed Moab. Wildlife started to creep back into the town during the day, rather than wait for the quiet of the night. They too were disoriented by the unusual hush. Deer initiated traffic jams on Main Street, as seeing them brought a sense of peace and no one wanted to hurry them away. One had to guess if they just saw a dog rush through the playgrounds, or if it was a stealthy coyote exploring its new realm. Reports of bears visiting household yards became normal- they were the new menace instead of college youth on Spring Break. But the visiting wildlife were quiet, making that the biggest difference to the human visitors. 

	As we‚Äôve established pre-cautions such as masks and social distancing, the people began to return. They discovered their recreational activities that took place outdoors was a natural way to socially distance. Moab is an ideal place for domestic travel, so the yearns to discover a new place could be met. Restaurants and hotels followed government mandates for occupancy levels, so the locals began to work again. Traffic returned to the Moab streets and with it the sounds of people, engines, horns carried through the breeze. 

	While we‚Äôve begun our way back to some kind of normal, we‚Äôre all still apprehensive about the return of silence.",,,,,

                                My husband is active duty Air Force. Most base housing is several miles away in Seaside, Ca. However, we were given the option to move into the historical housing on post, which meant my husband could walk to work and we have a stunning view of the Monterey Bay and Pacific Ocean. This also means that we must show our identification whenever we return home and obey base regulations. So must the thousands of language students attending DLI (Defense Language Institute). It means my daughter couldn't have a birthday party this summer. Students under my husband could head to a local pub or bar to celebrate their birthdays either. My daughter couldn't play on the playground with friends, and the students here had to collect their meals from the mess hall to take back to their dorms instead of chatting with classmates. My daughter couldn't go back to school after spring break and the language students had to begin distance learning and quarantine. As difficult as it was for my daughter to be without her friends, she could still play in the yard and hug her mother. My husband's students had to go months with no physical contact. However, these protocols were instituted to keep everyone safe whether or not they live on base. How difficult must it have been for base leadership to tell us families and students that we couldn't do the things that make us happy? That the mission must continue in spite of this pandemic? I don't envy their job.",,,,,

She discusses how the pandemic caused her to lose both of her jobs but says she is grateful that her state and local government responded the way that they did, or things could be much worse. Kelsey feels that she has grown closer with her family who are in various places across the United States, and that the increasing prevalence of technology such as Zoom makes it possible to communicate with them. Kelsey talks about the impact of COVID-19 on the LGBTQ+ community by the cancellation of Pride Month events and the LGBTQ+ community being at increased risk for exposure by those who are most vulnerable. Kelsey talks about how her partner works in news and she relies on them to get updates about what is happening, as well as checking the news on her iPhone She also talks about how she has learned to establish boundaries with her partner and that being together frequently can be both good and bad. Kelsey believes that masks will be mandated indoors a year from now, at least where she lives, and is optimistic that people in the LGBTQ+ community are actively participating in preventative measures.",,,,,

                                I am very lucky. I have a job that allows me to work 12-hour shifts, which means I have three or four days off a week.  I used to have the time while my daughter was at school and my wife (a teacher) was at work to relax or work on my master's classes. These classes take concentration and time to read and write, and noise is very distracting to me.  I should also mention that we purposely bought a small house, less than 1300 sq. feet. Suddenly in March, 2020, my world (at the risk of sounding selfish) was changed. My wife was teaching from home, juggling rooms back and forth with me for computer usage etc., while my daughter was asking for help with school.  The voice mail attached is a memory I have of my comfortable little environment changing. This particular voicemail surely caused stress and anxiety to the parents of 16,000 students in one district. Even today listening to it feels ominous. Ironically, today I dropped my daughter off for the first time at in-person school, and I was sad to see her go.

There's always flashing lights, traffic, and tons of people everywhere, so seeing this place looking like a ghost town is unbelievable.

                                Over the past 14 weeks, I have had the opportunity to work on The Journal of the Plague Year digital archive with Arizona State University. I learned a vast amount over the course of the internship, such as how to write press releases, collection plans, blog posts and other forms of advertising for the archive. I also learned about the ins and outs of archiving and the behind-the-scenes considerations that are involved in building and maintaining an archive. 

This was my very first graduate school class and as such, I wasn‚Äôt sure that starting with an internship was the best idea, but after the first week or two I realized that this was the perfect way to start, since it was basically getting a preview of the type of work someone in the public history field would be doing and I got very excited, determined that this was the type of career I wanted to pursue.  

The writing for publication skills that I have started to develop, I think will be extremely valuable as those skills are not just applicable to public history, but any career field really. The oral history project also provided the opportunity to work on my interviewing skills. Oral histories are vital to the study of history and even though this is an area I still need to work on, at least now I have the basic foundation to build on. 

For my collection within the archive, I chose to focus on Law Enforcement, as that is a community that is near and dear to my heart. I currently work in law enforcement and I have family that does as well. When we discussed silences in our weekly readings, we talked about how to identify silences and how to work towards filling them. I noted that there were very few if any, submissions to the archive from the perspective of law enforcement so I wanted to work towards filling that silence. 

Overall, this internship was a great experience and entry into both the public history field and graduate studies. I know that the skills I have developed here will serve me well as I continue my graduate studies!",,,,,

SF Symphony Associate Principal Bass, Dan Smith, is contributing to the movement by adding sound. In this video, Smith plays Adam Ben Ezra's ""Can't Stop Running"" in front of a variety of street art installments in San Francisco's Hayes Valley. As a former San Francisco resident, the sound produced by Smith, coupled with the art, feels exactly like the ""City by the Bay."" Art and culture are the heartbeat of San Francisco.

                                Nursing homes and prisons provide the perfect breading ground for coronavirus. For this reason the nation's correctional facilities have been hard hit by the virus. This Tweet, by James King, a formerly incarcerated man, draws attention to the continued spread of the virus within Folsom Prison in California. The news story King links to in his Tweet contains a video of Governor Gavin Newsom explaining the measures already taken to mediate the spread of the virus and upcoming plans. In the video Newsom mentions several things that alarmed me. 1. Numerous individuals with active Covid infections were released from California correctional facilities. Was this a wise decision? Or was it the smart decision that shows compassion for the individual. Prison is no place to suffer through a horrible illness. 2. When talking about releasing people from correctional facilities early he stresses these  were individuals who are ""non, non, non, non sex offenders"". This sounds like they are only considering releasing those convicted of non-violent crimes, but isn't there a chance someone who has spent 20+ years in prison been reformed? Isn't that the point of incarceration, to reform the person? 3. There are individuals that meet the criteria laid out for early release but they have no where to go or no plan. In speaking with criminal justice reform advocates in California personally I was told there are numerous non-profit organizations ready to assist anyone that is released early.",,,,,

Many students in poverty with food insecurity, family instability, and even homelessness are also lacking a quality education due to the pandemic and virtual learning. Along with these already existing problems, these students also lack some of the necessary requirements to learn at all including internet access and availability of technology. This is leading them to fall farther behind than they already were.",,,,,

                                Professional sports have been a way for our nation to heal in the face of tragedy. It has given us a distraction from the everyday struggles and misfortunes. But this time is different, with a virus that's easily transmitted and unknowingly spread we face a problem we never thought we'd face. The ethics of continuing sports became unclear and the athletes safety was in the balance. Putting ourselves in their shoes is difficult when we look to sports as an escape from life in involuntary seclusion.

                                In January 2015, my mom got very sick and was in the hospital for 2 weeks, 3 days of which were in the ICU with a breathing tube. She was diagnosed with severe COPD and has required at-home oxygen ever since. Her disease has now progressed to end-stage. Last year, she received a non-invasive ventilator to use at night. A lot of people with COVID-19 have breathing problems even after recovering from the disease. Some of these people might have permanent lung damage and require at-home oxygen therapy and possibly non-invasive ventilators.

The first recording is the sound of an oxygen machine. The second is the sound of the ventilator. At the end of the ventilator recording is the alarm that sounds when it does not detect any breathing. These sounds demonstrate the impact of COVID-19 has on its victims and the legacy it will leave behind long after the disease itself has gone away.

                                Prior to interning the JOTPY internship I thought we would be doing a lot of submissions for the archive to build it and maybe online work to raise awareness of the archive. I had no real knowledge of public history and was going in not expecting it to be such an important part of the archive. Throughout the internship I developed many skills such as curating, how to write a blog, press release and mission statement, and how to build an individual archive collection. I realized my colloquial writing was weak during the internship since many of the projects involved reaching out directly to the general public and speaking plainly. I was once quite adept at this but being an undergrad and now a graduate student these skills had become quite rusty as I endeavored to perfect my academic writing.

 I had to learn to work as a team in the internship and also reach out to regular non academics for submissions and these socially based experiences were uncomfortable for me since I am more of an introvert. However, throughout the internship I came to really value the camaraderie and community the interns built together. Before the internship I shied away from group projects as a necessary evil to be avoided at all costs however the internship showed me how much fun working with others could be and to value a great team. The internship also allowed me to network with other people including fellow interns, teachers and archive associates. The internship gave me real world experience of my historical skills introduced me to many new skills set that could pertain to future employment. Overall, it was a great experience that I wouldn‚Äôt trade for the world.",,,,,

I had some tension I needed to get off my chest, apparently, but I survived this first half of the fall. It is draining to be faced with at least a handful of people every day who radiate contempt for your safety or the dozens who behave carelessly, repeatedly, carelessly or the few who make obstacles of themselves to prove a point. It is draining to not be alone all year and yet pretend, by and large, that all is mostly well, all year",,,,,

                                Dave Ruff is a military veteran and recent graduate of the PhD program in Anthropology (Nautical Archaeology) from Texas A&M University. Dave was working in Croatia on a Roman shipwreck for his dissertation project. 



Dave is a really great friend and mentor. He is always willing to talk about his life experiences - in and out of the Navy - especially when it comes to money and investments. Dave is a hard-working individual who takes his role as an academic very seriously. I was extremely happy for Dave when I found out that he would be graduating in May 2020. He started in the program at Texas A&M a year or two before I did, but he moved from Texas to North Carolina to be closer to his grandchildren and this pushed him back a little. 



Dave and I had been planning graduation for a few months. We helped each other check all the final boxes on the graduation checklist and buy robes. We were both really excited for the event. I hadn't seen Dave in about a year, so I was excited to see him in person at the graduation. Graduation in May 2020 was cancelled due to COVID-19.



This email details a conversation between Dave and I. I was serving on the COVID-19 mission with the Texas Army National Guard and used the money I earned from that mission to pay off my house. I thanked him for his money mentorship throughout the years. 



The email goes on to detail how all of Dave's summer plans for research had been cancelled due to COVID-19, but that being a grad and being locked down had given him time to work out and lose some weight - a goal that we both had, but he fulfilled better than I!  



I wanted to highlight this email chain, as I feel that it brings humanity to the experience of Veteran PhD students, recent graduates, and researchers during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,,,

Cuando d√≠as atr√°s se mostraba favorable al uso del hidr√≥xico de cloro para combatir al Covid-19, ahora afirma que el consumo de carne de alpaca y llama es efectivo para hacerle la contra a la enfermedad.

¬´El consumo de alpaca y llama combate el coronavirus. Ojo. La llama, ¬°hay que consumir carne de llama!, est√° comprobado cient√≠ficamente que combate al Covid-19 que est√° matando a nuestra gente. Yo invito al pueblo de Arequipa y del Per√∫ a consumir carne de llama, que es brillisimo¬ª, manifest√≥ en una actividad p√∫blica.

 C√°ceres Llica dict√≥ esta exhortaci√≥n a diversos ciudadanos de su regi√≥n.

Por otro lado, tambi√©n dijo sostener comunicaci√≥n directa con Rusia para importar, lo m√°s pronto posible, la vacuna en este pa√≠s desarrollada, a la regi√≥n Arequipa.



Todo lo que indica el gobernador es de su propio criterio si bases cient√≠ficas luego dijieron que lo que dice de la carne es completamente falso.

She compares and contrasts this lockdown and pandemic with the 19 months she spend in a sanatorium being treated for tuberculosis (TB) many years ago.

                                I joined the Journal of the Plague Year Covid-19 archive before the internship experience began. I contacted Dr. Tebeau and asked how I could contribute to the archive to develop a K-12 teaching experience. I quite literally hit the ground running. I had imagined slowly starting the work; however, I quickly realized it was like drinking from a firehose, and I loved it. Before this experience, I hadn't had much interaction with rapid response archives. They were a new concept to me, and the internship is where I learned what they were and how they functioned. As a student sitting in a history class, I think it's easy to see history as systematic and well planned because, by the time we are reviewing it, there has been some organization. Being part of the rapid response archive shows the exceptional amount of work it takes to archive history.



While there is never a good time for a global pandemic to strike, this pandemic started during a beautiful place in my graduate studies. I had taken two of my core courses and a methods class. So, I felt prepared when discussing silences in the archive, biases, and other responsibilities held by the archive. This internship was a great way to use what I had learned over the last nine months and apply it rather than waiting until I had graduated to apply these skills. This application of expertise is something that doesn't usually occur during courses of study. I have also found that the internship has helped me shape my virtual class schedule as we head into the fall. While my district presented me with a virtual bell schedule to follow, it seemed like a lot to wrap my mind around, but I applied Dr. Kole's model for the internship to my class, sent it off to my instructional coach, and she loves it! While it's not directly related to the archive, the online pedagogy has been helpful. 



My favorite thing about working with the archive was curating. I just loved seeing all of the items come through and reading the stories attached to them. Beyond that, I feel like I have a great base of people I can now lean on through the rest of my time at ASU. I now have teacher friends in California with whom I am now sharing distance learning ideas. I hope these are the things that stand out when people think back to the Covid-19 pandemic. While it seems to be tearing through our country and pulling us apart, there's been a lot of good to come. I'm eternally grateful to have been presented with this opportunity, and I cannot wait to see how large this archive grows.",,,,,

                                This essay was produced as a part of the American Studies program at California High School in San Ramon, California. The essay is in response to the prompt ""Is America currently living up to its core values?"" This essay argues that America is living up to it's core value of hard-work which is shown by Americans' beliefs about work, but it is not living up to it's value of equality as it can still be seen in many areas today. It also includes references to the following modern examples: inequality in the workplace and Americans caring more about work than most other countries. This essay looks at when these values were introduced and how well America is currently doing at keeping up with these values.",,,,,

                                Before news of the coronavirus broke, there was no idea of social distancing. Everyone would lay on top of each other and connect. But, with COVID, there was a dramatic shift and people quickly became scared of each other. I think this video is important because it can offer hope for people that one day we might be able to sit next to each other and talk without any fear.

                                This interview shares the perspective of not only a college student learning during the pandemic, but also a student athlete. Preston Potter strives to maintain his job, his grades, and also stay in athletic shape, while also trying to keep a sense of team brotherhood while staying safe. 

We explored how he tried to juggle all of this, stay sane, and lead a normal life. 

Preston gives a positive outlook on the struggles and challenges he faces, focused solely on achieving a dream career of being a professional baseball player. 



It is a unique look into how different students are handling the many balls they have in the air between work, school and practice.",,,,,

                                When I embarked on the journey that was the JOTPY internship, I was unsure of what it would entail. I knew there would be assignments centered around collecting information in regards to COVID-19, but I did not know the extent. I was very surprised to learnt that we would be in fact completing our own oral histories. 

At the beginning, it was easier to contribute items to the archive, and extremely fun. But, as the work got more in depth, things got tougher. I had dabbled in oral history before, but had only done it to the extent of transcribing myself. By being introduce to Otter AI, my job got a lot easier. However, I'm still not a fan of oral history transcription. 

This course/internship taught me a plethora of skills. These included working with a team, curating fro an archive, software skills and more which I hope to incorporate in my future classes and career. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the course and look froward to seeing it come full circle.

                                Police brutality has been a big issue in our society today. It's already gotten nearly 700 people killed this year. Specifically within the Black community, they are constantly being racially targeted by the police when they are innocent and not a threat to anyone. The Black Lives Matter protests prove to show how America is not living up to their core values at all. This topic is extremely important to me because I am an African-American myself and it directly affects me and people who look just like me.",,,,,

                                Due to Covid-19 my uncle's birthday party was turned into a Zoom get together. The participants were asked to create  a video and submit it before the event. Normally, I probably would have just said a simple hello but feeling isolated and full of stored  creativity I decide to make song. Aiso, I had lost my job due to covid.  The subject of the song was the wish we, I , have to interact with fellow humans at a time when we are not able to.  Who even knew what Zoom was before Covid and would I have ever tried to create a song with a harmonica if i was not quarantined, probably not. I do not think I even said the word ""quarantine"" more than once a year, and then only for a crossword puzzle. I tried to create a song that expressed my feelings for the time and create a performance piece that was challenging for me to do. I think after the tenth take my lip muscles were cramped and I had actual lip abrasions from sliding the harmonica back and forth.  The finished product was rough and maybe one of the other 30 takes would have been better but i was on a birthday dead line so it is what it is. Unfortunately, the video file proved too big or the sound too bad that when my video was played for the Zoom ""party"" most of the sound was lost. Hopefully, it was not edited out. This little video will always be my gateway memory of time spent during the Covid-19 lock down. Through this song I will remember everything that happened, which was and is a lot. During my time at Brooklyn college getting my MA in education there was a focus on different learning styles which I think is typified by my video.

                                If you were to take a stroll down Main St. of Huntington Beach, you might be surprised by what you see.



I work in downtown Huntington Beach. Protests around these three topics has been quite regular. With a vast mixture of people wearing and not wearing facial coverings as mandated by the state. On this particular day there was a ""black lives matter"" protest, which was accompanied and/or countered by Christian evangelists as well as a single individual protesting for the re-opening of California businesses. 



In overhearing a conversation amongst the Christian group, it seems they feel that Covid-19 has been brought on as a punishment to those who have not repented for their sins. Here God is used as an authority figure to insight fear and shame to outgroup members or non-Christians. The pandemic seems to have had an impact on the effect of community in religion in that members that choose to gather in person must view the pandemic in a light that cannot effect them.

                                Before starting this internship, I had little to no knowledge of working behind the scenes in public history. My focus is on public history, but I am still learning the ins and outs. I learned many valuable lessons on not only public history but also working with the public in an academic field. For me, some of the most useful parts of the internship were the oral histories and the ethics of the archives. I learned about the importance of transcripts and how much work goes into recording oral history. When it comes to ethics, I am still learning, but I am grateful to have experienced how JOTPY protects people's privacy and sensitive information. I am now aware of when and how to redact sensitive information and the best practices for redacting in an archival setting. I am more aware of the best file types to use when preserving digital items. I am eager to learn more about the digital side of public history from Omeka to apps. 



I chose to preserve the impact of the pandemic on the food industry, food habits, and body image because of my tie to the industry, my interest in food history and fat studies. It has been a difficult topic to work on, but the experience I gained working on the Foodways collection has been priceless. In hindsight, I wish I had chosen a more relatable collection because I often felt like I was alone in left field. Other interns were able to share and exchange items, that did not happen with my collection as much as others. Besides a couple of interns, I did not get the chance to network with others. Food is a relatable subject, but the industry is not. I found areas that I need to develop, including my networking skills and being confident in what I bring to the academic table. I gained a lot of confidence in my abilities through this internship, and I am grateful for the areas; it helped me see where I have room to grow. As a student with learning disabilities from a non-academic background, I was the fish out of the water, but so many of my skills did translate. The internship also gave me the push I needed to leave my comfort zone and view myself outside of the industry I've been working in for decades. If I could keep working on this archive, I would in a heartbeat, I am grateful for all that I have learned this summer.

We also discussed his perceptions of COVID-19 both at the beginning of the pandemic and now. His perceptions have not changed much, although he believes that it‚Äôs important to listen to scientists as new information is released. We then talked about government response to COVID-19, as well as the response at the University of Cincinnati.

                                This news article from News 4 Jax highlights events in my hometown of Jacksonville, Florida, that were canceled as a result of COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic. Most notable was that the tour version of Hamilton was supposed to have come to Jacksonville, but was canceled due to the virus. Concerts and theater are one of the many ways people can connect and develop a sense of community. Not only that, the amount of canceled events hints at the economic opportunities lost, both for the city itself and for those involved with the performance.",,,,,

                                I chose to submit a letter that my fiance and I will be sending out to guests of our October 4th, 2020 wedding. My fiance popped the question two years ago and ever since then we have been planning our dream ceremony. Something about us as people, we LOVE a good party. Nothing sounded sweeter than inviting our friends and family to join us in celebration. 



As COVID-19 surfaced in the world, we watched as our dream day slowly seemed less and less likely to happen. Now, I think a lot of people wonder, how can you possibly have a wedding right now? How can you be upset that people are choosing not to come? At this point, for us, it is not about being upset over people choosing to come or not to come, it is about my fiance and I being able to celebrate each other as a queer couple on a day and in a space that has always felt out of reach or off limits altogether. 



When we sat down to draft this letter, I was feeling angry. Half of my wedding party has canceled (one of the grooms party canceled just today), our guest list went from 180 to 25-30, dinner has been canceled and we will not be having a traditional reception but an elongated cocktail hour. We sat with the reality. My calm has been found in those that will be joining us. Our nearest and dearest. Overall, our people are the most important and we want them to feel safe while being able to join us in any capacity that they are able to. It has taken some creative thinking but we have managed to plan an intimate ceremony for everyone that will be joining us in person and via live-stream.



What we have come to realize is health and safety of our loved ones is most important to us and giving grace to those around you is really the only way to not loose your sh$! in the world right now. I'm ecstatic to celebrate how we can and ultimately, to create a covenant with the person I love the most. We have a lot of time together, might as well revel in all this sweetness.

                                Last night around midnight, we learned that Trump tested postive for COVID. And I recognize it's not the most mature move, but this morning I woke up and started looking for Trump memes or memes about Trump. On Twitter I found the hashtag #TrumpHasCovid and found this video. It shows a lego representation of President Trump at a podium, and the audio plays several of his statements about COVID-19 and the pandemic. In the end, Trump gets run over by coronavirus (represented as a tomato) and it eats him, but spits out the tupet. Later, a street cleaner gets the tupet caught in his vechincle and it blows up.

                                Throughout quarantine it was clear that TikTok had spiked in popularity, from videos showing sour bread starters to the popular whipped coffee. My friends and I would constantly send each other videos of funny skits, animal videos, and topics that as college students we could relate to. However, when the video of George Floyd went viral thousands if not millions saw the video, TikTok soon transitioned from a funny/sarcastic platform to one that united many Gen Z and millennials. Fundraisers and protests were quickly organized and announced throughout the app. Videos of activists fighting for equality spread like wildfire, the platform worked as a method to spread any news and advice on and from protestors, statements like ‚ÄúBring water bottles, milk, masks and cover up to protect yourself from tear-gas, rubber bullets, make sure to help others if you are in so and so place‚Äù rung loud and clear. TikTok videos of police brutality towards protesters, Black Lives Matter protests, a clear sign of government abuse covered the pages of various social media platforms. This platform became a powerful tool to the point that it destroyed the famous 2020 Tulsa Trump Rally, when millions bought tickets as a joke only for the president to be met with a relatively empty stadium. In the following months the U.S. government found various excuses to have the app banned in the country the most popular being that the Chinese were using the app to steal personal information of its users. Whether or not this platform gets banned in 2020 is still unknown, but for now it is a staple of the Gen Z movement for change.

                                This essay was produced as a part of the American Studies program at California High School in San Ramon, California. The essay is in response to the prompt ""Is America currently living up to its core values?"" This essay argues America's failure at equality leads to the people using their right of protest and dissent. It also includes references to the following modern events: black lives matter movement, police brutality, gender inequality, and women's marches.",,,,,

In order to aid  low income students and families, Pittsburg is offering an estimate of 700-800 families with internet that would have otherwise gone without. The schools in the district it affects feel that  it will make a great impact for those who either have no internet or unstable internet services. Families that qualify for this service will pay no fees, and will help the some 20% of families with lack of or poor internet service.",,,,,

                                The audio recording are the sounds of my car and the cars around me as I drive home after another day at work on Dover AFB. I could explain and explore all the things that COVID impacted on the base as well as in regards to deployments, missions, and military/civilian personnel, but that will have to be a separate COVID story for another time. As for my car ride, the audio highlights one of the most confusing things about human behavior for me during the pandemic. Where was everyone going? Majority of businesses were closed. Visitation to family and friends were greatly discouraged. The beaches were closed. All the states around us were closing their borders. Yet, people were driving all about the roads like the COVID wasn‚Äôt going to stop them from being somewhere. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the base was still open and I was still going to work. Also, a good portion of the people living in or around Dover were military or military families. Still, traffic around me didn‚Äôt ever seem to really slow down or make sense connection to the pandemic. In fact, the closer you got to the base, the worse the traffic became because the base had closed all their gates but one. This meant that everyone who needed to be on base to work or go to medical (not much was open at the start of COVID and things are slowly working their ways back to somewhat ‚Äúnormal‚Äù hours) had to go through a singular gate. I would sit in my car for almost an hour, listening to my music and the music of the cars around me as I waited impatiently for my wheels to a spin a few more inches forward. 

In some ways, this audio clip reveals something special about the history of the pandemic. The audio and my story attached to it showcases not only the human nature to adapt, but also humanity‚Äôs resiliency to sustain a way of life. At the same time, pandemic unveils our values and driving force. For instance, were those driving around the pandemic going to work for monetary value? Were they driving to see loved ones through a window? Maybe they were driving just to have a purpose? Or they just trying to escape the confines of the sanctuary of their home? Was it about politics? This also brings about the question of fear. Fear of being alone. Fear of confinement. Fear of death. Fear of boredom. Fear of lost freedom.

                                For younger users of the ‚ÄãArizona Persian Cultural Center‚Äã, the Scottsdale home of the ‚ÄãIranian American Society of Arizona‚Äã, the pandemic-driven transition to virtual classes and events has been relatively easy.



But for older members, who‚Äôve struggled to use Zoom and long for the potlucks and Bingo they enjoyed before COVID-19, the road has been rockier.



‚ÄúBefore (the pandemic), we had a hard time getting younger people to come to the center,‚Äù vice president and fundraising chair Fariba Ansari said. ‚ÄúNow, we have a hard time getting older people online.‚Äù



IASAz‚Äôs mission ‚Äã‚Äî ‚Äãmaintaining a ‚Äúsense of community‚Äù among Iranian Americans and others by promoting Iranian culture and language ‚Äã‚Äî has become more important than ever in the face of COVID-19, according to the organization. With its physical location shuttered since March, IASAz had to get creative to continue offering the Farsi classes, discussions and other events it used to host in person.



Ansari and Malie Malihi, the group‚Äôs treasurer and outreach programs chair, spoke with the Luce Foundation‚Äôs Southwest Stories Project about how the organization is working to keep ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù members and the broader public engaged, while securing funds to help families in need.",,,,,

                                I was an essential worker at Starbucks in the suburbs of Chicago, IL. My COVID-19 symptoms soon began and I was in quite the denial that I had it as I rarely get sick. Though through the testing I was positive and symptoms such as loss of taste and smell grew me certain that I had the virus. At first I was really frightened because of the things I've seen on many media platforms. My symptoms, and condition was mild with just chest tightness and as I listed above so fear was something that really made this virus something more than it was for me. Yet I do fear this for many others. I was lucky to have this virus come out when I was young and if I was the age of 80 getting it then I might not be writing this as we speak. I write this poem as a person who lived through it and hopefully it adds to what this pandemic meant to me the individual.

                                Hello everyone, my name is Eddie Wu. I was born US but raised in Taiwan, a country that is nearby China. That means we are the first few countries that is influenced by COVID-19 due to the geography distance. At that time, my family was separated, me and my siblings living at Tempe, taking classes. My parents were at Taiwan that time facing the COVID-19, my parents are asked to stay home and put on masks when they go out. Then one more month later, the first case has happened in US. First, I think I will just stay here doing normal classes and will stay normal. Then my parents suddenly asks my siblings to go back to Taiwan, because Taiwanese government have already showing their ability to control the pandemic at Taiwan. So, it suddenly changed my day that time. My siblings are back to Taiwan, and I stayed here alone. It is scary that while the first few cases are founded in US, I am the only few person who put on masks in public places. I still remember at March, when I went to one of the store to get groceries, I have my masks on and my gloves on, some other customers told her child that I am sick so I put on my masks. During the pandemic time, it does change the ways I get groceries, socializing with friends, and taking class. The pandemic have make me getting bigger amount of groceries in once. When I am trying to doing activities with friends, mostly we are doing it on voice chat apps, if we have to meet outside, I always ask them to have their mask prepared, and also I will bring hand sanitizer to clean our hands. The last the changes the most is my classes, I am an UAS student, most of my class will be really hard to teach online because we don‚Äôt actually see the items in real life if the class is online, so most of my class are really hard for me that time, because it is online, somethings aren‚Äôt clear enough and I need to spent more hours to learn it myself. These are some major things that changes in my life during pandemic.",,,,,

                                The story I am submitting is about people losing their jobs and homes during this pandemic. It is important to me because I know some people who have lost their jobs due to this and they were struggling to pay their bills, wondering when their next meal was going to come, even the parents who had to quit their jobs because schools had closed down so that was another stressor during this time.

The essay is in response to the prompt ""Is America currently living up to its core values?"" This essay argues how the values of equality and the right to protest are not being lived up to by Americans today. It also includes references to the following modern events: The core values of equality and the right to protest are not being lived up to today. Today, COVID-19 pandemic is spreading and normalizing racial inequality towards Asians. The president is adding on to this situation by constantly using the terms ""China Virus"" and ""Kung FLu"" even when many people pointed it out to him that it was considered racist. Additionally, the Black Lives Matter movement helps to support how the law enforcement is violating the basic right to protest. Peaceful protesters gathered to show their support for blm however the police dispersed the crowds by using excessive force.",,,,,

Then, when NPR started reporting that President Donald J Trump was going to ban downloading the app, I decided to download it and see what it was like. It's a funny amalgamation of short videos, sometimes music, that ranges from bizarre to hilarious. I keep seeing videos from the member TreyTV who does hilarious impressions of DJT, this one is a spin off the Idaho man who make a Tik Tok to a Fleetwood Mac song while drinking Ocean Spray. I have to say, as bleak as thing are right now, it feels so great to laugh.",,,,,

Public demonstrations historically have involved the ‚Äúmass mobilization of bodies,‚Äù according to Tiera Rainey, program director for the Tucson Second Chance Community Bail Fund.



But when the novel coronavirus struck, prompting warnings against crowds and close contact, Arizona‚Äôs new reality of social distancing forced organizers to rethink that framework.



‚ÄúComing together is a challenge in a pandemic,‚Äù said Rainey, who also is an organizer for Black Lives Matter Tucson. ‚ÄúCreating virtual community and innovation ... has been really important in this moment.‚Äù



Organizers had digitized some advocacy work well before COVID-19 arrived in March. But with the crisis pushing more people online ‚Äì ‚Äãinternet use surged 50% to 70% in response to closures and other COVID-19 restrictions, according to Forbes ‚Äì virtual activism became the primary tool for agitators seeking to build connections and momentum, not just a complementary one.",,,,,

The spread came unexpectedly upon my doorsteps

As I held onto my internal truth for all reasons  

Hoping it was not happening as the whole world came to a stop

Hearing the sounds of the death toll increasing echoing through the television 

Left with no option but to dive behind a facemask, not so much so as for its protectiveness

But more so for its veiling usage to hide from the rest, as the scenes began to flood with people

The future was no longer in my hands; my ten fingers could not grasp my dreams

The website promotes proper COVID-19 practices and is targeted for the Native American population. The webpage includes short videos, articles, resources, and podcasts that focus on combating COVID-19. For this project Cate created a coloring book based off his cartoon Without Reservations. The cartoon-based coloring book looks at the pandemic in a humorous and cultural manner. The coloring book is printable, and a printed version has also been distributed throughout Native communities.

                                This is my portfolio for my 15 weeks as an intern working with The Journal of the Plague Year. I was anxious to learn the skills involved in gathering, creating, and archiving materials to preserve history in our lifetime. The pandemic of COVID-19 is a once in a century occurrence, and I felt it was very important to preserve our thoughts, emotions, photographs, jokes, and events that are shaping our lives now.



Generally, I‚Äôve been fascinated by archives and the potential they hold for telling our stories. I‚Äôve also been frustrated by the lack of accessibility they all present. I‚Äôm hoping that the digital archive techniques we have employed will ease that problem. We‚Äôve had the freedom to use tags (or, in archive-speak, folksonomy) to make the content searchable and accessible to all who come after us. In addition to archive work, my branch of historical interest is in the everyday lives of people. This digital repository satisfies both passions.

Lastly, working on preserving the events of this pandemic has helped me find my way during this difficult time. I feel that I've been able to contribute--at least a little bit--and thus been able to be causative over some little part of this global nightmare.



I am earning my Master‚Äôs degree in order to teach at the college where I work now. I‚Äôve been functioning as a TA for the last several years as well as working as a classified staff member. I should graduate in May 2021, and become an adjunct. However, with all learning remote and the campus closed, hiring may be delayed. My mission is to inspire a love of history and the ability to think critically about the past and present. Too often history is still being taught as a memorization exercise of dates, names, and events. I will teach against that model and hopefully inspire a love of the past and its lessons and stories in my students.



I want to thank all of our staff at ASU for delivering a professional learning experience‚ÄîI was very lucky to have had the opportunity to be a part of it.",,,,,

                                Within my contribution to the Covid-19 Archives project, I wanted to reflect on how my beliefs have changed over the year of 2020. In best coming up with where my thinking has been, I developed a few xelect questions which could be asked, or answered by anyone in contemporary settings and are highly relevant to any life, spiritual or secular. I will reflect on insights I have internalized from both secular and religious texts. It is my underline perception that all religions strive towards a union with a divine principle, In this way they are all equal. As famously spoken by Swami Vivekananda ‚ÄúWe believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true.‚Äù 

So long as a heart has a desire for God; In whichever form the seeker finds. The desire of man is grand, and will not stop on this side of infinity. Therefore, so long as the desire of an individual is to expand one's own awareness to ever greater extents, one will always be prepared for a wider more complex existence. 





How does your faith address the issue of ‚Äòevil‚Äô, ‚Äòsuffering‚Äô, or ‚Äòsin‚Äô within the world?



This question is a common contention of every faith, particularly with wide evidence of natural disasters and illnesses, culminating in widespread suffering within the human and animal world. As many ideas have been put forward through faiths and philosophies, many such explanations leave much to be desired. For instance; theories such as character building or developmental and growth theories. Ideas that God is ‚Äòtesting us‚Äô, or preparing us for something in the future. Such answers are unsatisfactory in that a God deemed as all loving would not Inflict suffering. Similarly freewill is given, or a deviation from moral principle. Yet the same question arises. What suffering is experienced because of ‚Äòfreewill‚Äô. To give a lit match to a child is dangerous because they do not know the burn of the fire. In a similar fashion, ideas which argue the fault of man do not give justice to the hardships of life in any given society. It is my belief, similar to what might be seen in non-dual Vedanta, that issues of suffering facing the world are a result of ignorance. That an individual, as a single focal point of reference is never isolated, yet rather synonymous with the whole of conscious awareness. 





What does your belief have to say of the relationship between the individual and the world?



 I am a centre of Thy golden light

                        And I its vast and vague circumference,

                  Thou art my soul great, luminous and white

                        And Thine my mind and will and glowing sense.

                  Thy spirit‚Äôs infinite breath I feel in me;

                  My life is a throb of Thy eternity. - Sri Aurobindo 



Personally, this is one of my favorite short poem reflections by Aurobindo. It is my understanding that I am not alien to this world, yet rather emerge into it. As a tree produces a ripe fruit, the planet has produced the human brain as the most ‚Äòconscious fruit‚Äô. I appreciate the idea that we are to be shepherds of the earth and do right by the planet, as it is no different than us, and will be the ingredients of future generations.



What do your teachings define as a moral and ethical life? 



I believe in the concept of doing unto others as we would have done to yourself, or the idea of doing right by one's neighbor just the same as one's enemy. It is because I know that who I define as an enemy defines myself. Rather, the Idea for me is to dissolve conceptions of enemies or friends alike. That all may have the opportunity to be admired with fresh eyes as pure and worthy of love and respect. Once the obsession of noticing the wrongs of others has been observed, we may slowly begin perceiving our own wrongdoings.



Thank you for all and any who took the time to read over this! I hope you too felt compelled to consider such questions. This year has left all with tremendous insight.",,,,,

                                I decided that I wanted to place emphasis on the importance of wearing a mask, because I witness so many people either failing to wear one properly, or sometimes failing to even wear one at all. It honestly is such an easy contribution to just stick a piece of fabric over one‚Äôs nose and mouth, so I do not understand why such a large group of people still fight it. The most common complaint that stems from wearing a mask is the fact that it can be hard to breathe in. While I do understand this concern, breathing through a face covering is a lot better than breathing with a respiratory device in the hospital. Even though face coverings have been required for months now, and they are scientifically proven to help stop the spread of the virus, people still argue the counter. Not to mention that if more people just started adhering to health guidelines properly, we could help curb the pandemic altogether. Suffering for a few months means that we will be closer to a world without masks sooner than if we do not take this seriously. I am sure the public is so accustomed to seeing signs in front of stores and buildings regarding the fact that face coverings are required, but I feel like the importance of why is not stressed enough. Wearing masks is something that is beyond us; it is for the sake of others, and more people need to understand this. Just because we might not be afraid of contracting COVID-19, this does not mean that we should not respect the people around us. It is just flat-out selfish to claim that it is hard to breathe so one does not want to wear a mask, because it is not about the individual. This pandemic is a worldwide issue, and should be treated as such. Even though it may seem unimportant to some, wearing masks are the least one can do when going about their business in the world. Making excuses not to wear one is simply not acceptable.

                                This is a manuscript published recently in Japan regarding the survival time of COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) and the influenza A virus (IAV). Overall, the results showed that SARS-CoV-2 and IAV were inactivated more rapidly on skin surfaces than on other surfaces such as stainless steel/glass/plastic. However, the survival time of SARS-CoV-2 was significantly longer for than for IAV. Moreover, both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV in the mucus/medium on human skin were completely inactivated within 15 s by ethanol treatment. This showed that the COVID-19 virus we are facing now survives longer on our skin than influenza A virus, and thus it could spread much easier. Also, this paper shows the importance of sanitization, and how ethanol is one method that is useful in helping the virus to not be spread.",,,,,

                                The focus on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic is usually on the major cities and counties. But rural communities throughout Arizona are getting hit just as hard, especially now. Sarandon Raboin spoke with rural mayors around the state to see what steps they are taking, like mandating masks, to help stop the spread.

                                Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, August 2020 brought devastating wildfires to the state of California. Many of the Northern California fires were started as a result of the lightning produced during a massive - and rare - summer thunderstorm. 

 

The week leading up to the storm, I questioned the reliability of weather information as I had never experienced a severe summer storm in California. The night of the storm, I lay awake in my bed in awe of the sound of the storm. The combination of wind, rain, thunder and lighting produced incredibly loud sounds that lasted throughout the night. My family stayed snug in our beds. But when the storm continued into the morning hours, we decided to sit on our porch to take in the moment. The smell of rain in the summer was oddly refreshing. My kids were jumpy as none of them remember ever hearing thunder before. During a pause in the rain, we were walking between our home and my in-law‚Äôs home about 500 yards away from ours. The thunder hit at that very moment. I turned to look at my son and he was completely jumping out of his skin from fear of the thunder. Following each bout of thunder, silent lighting bolts shot across the sky. In the moment, we soaked in the beauty of nature. Little did we know that these beautiful bolts of lightning would cause some of the largest fires in California history. 



Immediately following the storm, fires spread across the state of California. While COVID-19 has completely changed life as we know it, we have found joy in being able to enjoy the outdoors. At the onset of the fires, even that reprieve was taken from us. I live directly between the SCU Lightning Complex and the LNU Lighting Complex fires, two of the first fires that erupted following the storm. The days immediately following the start of the fires brought record breaking days of heat well over 100 degrees. The hottest I have ever experienced in the San Francisco Bay Area. The region experienced rolling blackouts and even functioning air conditioners were so taxed that they struggled to keep the insides of homes cool. In addition to the heat, the skies were filled with ash. The air was so thick with ash it was difficult to even take a breath when outside. The outdoors, our place of solace, quiet and escape during this pandemic, was no longer an option for us.



On September 9, 2020, I woke up and opened my curtains to face a brilliant orange sky. The color of the sky was unlike anything I've ever seen in my life. It truly felt apocalyptic. The air smelled of an extinguished campfire. And the overall feeling was eerie. The weight of the COVID-19 pandemic hit me the day that I stood beneath an orange sky, breathing in the smell of the fires ravaging my beloved state. How did we get here? Will life ever feel normal again? It just can‚Äôt get worse, can it? While I stood frozen in place, I heard the sound of birds chirping in the distance. This simple sound gave me the reassurance that I needed. We can do hard things. This too shall pass. I just hope it passes quickly.",,,,,

The session called attention to the importance of documenting significant history while living in a pandemic and discussed the Who, What, Where, When, Why and How of collecting objects, ephemera and materiel in the time of crisis. The presenters (Stacey Swigart, Drexel Lenfest Center for Cultural Partnerships; Thomas Lonnberg and Tory Schendel Cox, Evansville Museum of Arts; Juilee Decker, Rochester Institute of Technology; and Redmond Barnett, Historian/Consultant) reviewed best practices, safety measures, look at museums who are collecting and how communities can/are involved and what communities can do to document your local/regional history.

It is important for me to tell, so that everyone is aware of how unprepared we were. Had we prepared, we could have saved lives.

                                In this interview, I, Hailey, am interviewing Sofia about how she has handled stress before and after COVID. I ask her about how she's made adjustments to her coping mechanisms and how she is handling graduating during COVID and having been abroad during COVID as well. The COVID-19 pandemic uprooted a lot of our lives and our plans we had for the future. It is about making adjustments when necessary and learning to cope and be positive!",,,,,

                                I served on the COVID-19 Relief Mission for 93 days with the Texas Army National Guard. The attached orders and email detail my timeline on the mission and my preparation in late June to come off orders by my end date of 18 July 2020. 



I will not give any more details than that when it concerns orders or paperwork for orders in this public forum. I just wanted to add to military and National Guard perspective of this story as thousands of National Guardsman served on the COVID-19 Relief Mission. In Texas, the same rules applied to this mission as to an OCONUS deployment in terms of leaving mission. The orders were also longer than 90 days for most Soldiers which allowed them to earn 50% Post 9/11 G.I. Bill College Benefits if they had never served on Active Duty Orders (outside of training) before.",,,,,

The newspaper article I look at also shows the shocking differences between the two, like the zero urgency for quarantining and the different kinds of masks and methods that were used to try and treat these illnesses.

                                I found this story of an in-person graduation to be a bit tragic story. This is because people wanted to believe that COVID was simply ignored in some states. While living in NC we had people that felt that it was just too little risk to slow down large gatherings, we also had restrictions that prevented this exact behavior. I saw many people were doing graduations online, and some were just not even having graduations at all. But this article shows that there was an attempt to hold this ceremony with indications that people were maybe encouraged to wear masks, but they were not mandatory. While there is no indication of more COVID positive people after the graduation, there is a sense of dread to have to go be tested especially after what should be a cause for celebration.",,,,,

                                My covid-19 story started at the end of January, 2020. I was working as a Marine Operations Manager for Holland America Group, which is comprised of four cruise companies: Holland America Line, Seabourn, Princess Cruises, and P&O Australia. As covid-19 spread across Asia in January, we stood up our Emergency Response Center, which involved taking 12-hour shifts to support the ms Westerdam, which had been denied docking in multiple ports in Asia as a result of the covid outbreak on the Diamond Princess. Though there were no covid cases onboard the ms Westerdam, she was denied docking in Japan, China, Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, Vietnam, Guam, Philippines, and Taiwan. Our job was to ensure that our full complement of guest and crew had enough fuel and provisions, with toilet paper being of critical importance (seriously!), to make it until we could find a port that would allow the ship to dock. Eventually, the Cambodian government allowed the ship to dock in Sihanoukville to disembark guests, which became a political photo op of good will for Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen who attended the ship himself when it docked. 

But this story was just the beginning of the nightmare for cruise companies, and other maritime organizations. After working to disembark guests, the next hurdle was to repatriate crew, which was next to impossible with the extreme disruption to global travel, some crew members had spent months longer on the ships than anyone could have ever envisioned. Using our ships like ferries, we made plans to transport crew to their homes, but to compound the problem, local governments like South Africa and Mauritius were unwilling to accept their own nationals back when the ships arrived, which meant they had to keep sailing and further plans had to be made to get the crew home.

What you see in the object attached is the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and that of its member companies making a humanitarian appeal in their interactions with local port authorities who were blocking their own citizens from returning home during this crisis. We were working long days, 7 days a week to get our colleagues home - but there is only so much you can do when local authorities will not cooperate.

The object speaks to a desperate time in the maritime industry during the covid-19 pandemic.

The goal of this partnership was to create a project to say ""thank you for sheltering in place"" and ""thank you for supporting us"" to the community on behalf of San Francisco's essential workers. Paint the Void has created over 91 murals across San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland. This specific mural tells the story of how interconnected people are and how an act of kindness has the ability to improve life conditions for the entire community. The title of the mural is ""How we care shapes who we are."" The spirit of community is represented through this specific mural and the Paint the Void initiative.",,,,,

                                In my AP Literature class, we were reading the book Beloved by Toni Morrison. To make us more engaged with the book our teacher gave us a theme to create a three-part project with art, a model, and a poem. I can‚Äôt remember I hated this theme and wanted a different one where I had stronger ideas. The book Beloved is heavy, unsettling, and confusing. I remember thinking to myself I want to skip this unit. And then we did with a global pandemic that took away too many American lives. While I sat in the house for 5 months safely I could not turn away from the many glaring issues in America and across the world. It took a toll on me to watch people try to survive who were not as lucky as me. To come to terms with I realized if the world is falling apart I do not have to because I instead can spend time figuring out what I specifically can do. The Covid-19 pandemic was a fortunate fall that woke me up to what‚Äôs really going on.

                                My husband, son and I moved (back) to Durango, Colorado from Monument at the end of February. We closed on our house, started back at school and reconnected with the friends we missed while we were away. Then the news stories started popping up here and there about a new and unidentified virus that is showing up in cities. ""Good thing we live here!"" I thought to myself. We live in the mountains, in a scattered neighborhood outside a small town in a sparsely-populated area of the country. We'll be fine. 

My husband's job went to 100% telework. Since he works for the Federal Government, I figured it was just very precautionary and we settled into the convenience of having him home! My son's school went on spring break, more time for playing and friends! I saw on the news that all the schools in Wisconsin (my home state) closed for the rest of the year! Holy cow! I still figured we would not see anything real from this now-named Coronavirus. Then my son's school closed for the year. Suddenly, the entire nation, even our little rural hamlet, came to a shuddering halt.

 By now, it is into March, nearly April. Tourists still show up to get their last ski runs in, and first hikes and rafting trips of the year in. I suppose that is good. Our entire area relies on tourism so if we can keep things moving, that is a positive, right? 

Well it turns out there is a pretty huge downside of living in a remote area during a pandemic. Yes, we do not come into contact with many people, we don't have a freeway anywhere nearby, and we do not have a large airport. However, we also lack the resources to have a mass of patients at our hospital. There is one main medical facility that serves a very large area. If this virus shows up here, we could be doomed. With my husband and son home, we hunkered in to see what was going to happen. 

Fast forward to October, and we have had a handful of cases in our county and neighboring ones, despite the rush of Texas and California tourists this summer. We lost a couple cherished restaurants and establishments, and were not immune to this pandemic. But taking an assessment at the moment, I'm pretty proud of our area. There were arguments on masks, social distancing, sports, and restaurants, that shadowed the nation as a whole, but I saw communities band together like never before. Out of this crisis, there blossomed a new understanding and grace lent to our neighbors that we maybe did not express before. New programs popped up to help those who were struggling, because in reality, we were ALL struggling. This area historically struggles with suicide, and there has been an enormous push to reach out to everyone possible and offer all kinds of hands, or ears as the case may be. All in all, I am proud of my community and I am proud of how we are weathering this storm, among so much other commotion battling for our focus.

                                I had planned to take the summer off from classes but when I saw an opportunity to be part of real time archiving in relation to the crisis I was living through I eagerly jumped at the opportunity. While I was initially worried, we, as interns, would get stuck doing the repetitive tasks no one else wanted, I was thrilled to be part of the creation and problem-solving process of a real time archive. 

While most students in my program focus on American or Global history my focus has been on public history. One of the tenants of public history is involving everyone. The archive became a place to see this in real time. We weren‚Äôt collecting only around famous people, important people, or large movements. We wanted to collect the stories of everyday people and also took the time to figure out whose voices were missing and attempt to remedy that problem. To that end I took on an extra project to add Black voices to the archive. I collected a list of all the historically black colleges and universities and also searched for museums and cultural or heritage centers across the country that we could contact in hopes they would want to work with us to add those voices to the archive. 

In addition to curating and adding items to the archive each week we focused on learning a particular skill set related to the archive. The one I struggled with the most was oral history. Though I am fine speaking in public and am not an introvert, I found conducting my first two oral history interviews exceptionally unnerving. However, I also discovered how important they are and what an incredibly rich source of information oral histories represent. What I learned from oral histories was so impressive that I have plans to conduct an oral history program in conjunction with my local historical preservation commission in the future. I am also no longer nervous about conducting oral histories. 

By the end of our fifteen-week internship we had become even more than a team, we had become a family. I believe this was partially due to a shared crisis. We were living through the Covid-19 pandemic together. For many of us, our weekly Zoom (online meeting platform) was nearly the only face to face contact, though virtual, we had with anyone. This was the case for me. Another intern joked he was going to rename his journal about the project, ‚ÄúThe Summer I Distracted Myself from a Pandemic by Thinking about the Pandemic‚Äù. I realized that is exactly what happened. The pandemic really started in mid-March for me. I spent the initial month or so sewing face masks and that was how I kept myself focused and sane. Once the internship began in May I began processing my experience of the pandemic by working on the archive. I believe this summer will have been one of the defining moments of my life.

                                As I raised my three kids, they were fairly limited on the amount of screen time they could use every day. Screen time includes video games, phone time, TV, movies, etc. and they were allotted about two hours a day. When they were smaller, it was closer to an hour but once they all owned phones, it doubled. In March of 2020 when schools closed and we were stuck in the house because of Corona, their screen time grew quickly and exponentially. Despite my best efforts to keep them busy or more productively entertained, they played a lot of video games. When they play, they are very loud. I don't know if this is normal it is for my kids! I‚Äôve submitted a short audio clip of them playing Fortnite because when I think of Corona (especially the early days of strict quarantine), I remember the sounds of my kids playing video games.

                                All of my life I have been dreaming of graduation. As a little girl, I would try to imagine what I would wear, how I would walk across the stage (when I was younger, I wanted to catwalk across our auditorium stage like a model ‚Äì now that would just be embarrassing), what I would say in my valedictorian speech to part with my friends and teachers‚Ä¶ and when that moment for those daydreams finally came, it was nothing like I had originally planned.

	What was once a thrilling time for all of the ‚Äúlasts‚Äù turned into a last Zoom call, the last time logging into my high school Office account, the last email sent by my favorite teacher, and a last assignment turned in virtually. Not a senior prom, not a final picnic, not a fun-filled ‚Äúskip day‚Äù (unless you count the days since March 13th) ‚Ä¶ I am not upset, I am not bitter, and I certainly do not dwell on what could have been. I understand that this was for our safety, and I would rather sacrifice those events than put myself or the people I love in a place where we could become ill. 

	The day of graduation finally came after all of these years of waiting. What my school planned was very innovative, and I would choose this over a normal graduation any day. We filmed the speeches of the valedictorian and salutatorian, each student walking across the stage to receive their diploma from their family, compiled the clips into a video, and played it at our local drive-in. It was personalized for each student in our class of just sixty students. There were fireworks, gifts, and snacks for everyone in our class. 

	I am not one to reminisce on my high school days. I was the person in my class that just wanted to leave our small town for bigger things. However, I find myself welling up with tears writing this. What my high school did for our graduation was so considerate and accommodating for the world we now live in. There is even a YouTube video of our graduation, online forever, which would have never happened under normal circumstances. I attached a link to it ‚Äì my speech starts at 31:20 if you are interested.",,,,,

                                For more than three decades, ‚ÄãAndr√© House‚Äã just west of downtown has provided food, showers, temporary housing and other services to Arizonans experiencing homelessness or poverty.



In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of families seeking such services has almost doubled, said Ash Uss, the faith-based nonprofit‚Äôs coordinator of advocacy and partnerships.



‚ÄúWe have had families who show up and say, ‚ÄòI was just evicted,‚Äô or ‚ÄòI'm about to be evicted,‚Äô or ‚ÄòWe're living out of our car,‚Äô‚Äù Uss said. ‚ÄúThe need is greater than it ever was.‚Äù



A July report from ‚ÄãUniversity of Arizona researchers‚Äã suggests the spike in people seeking homeless services at Andr√© House and elsewhere in metro Phoenix may be just the beginning. Researchers found the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic shutdown could increase the state's homeless population ‚Äì about 11,000 as of January ‚Äì by 16% to 42%.",,,,,

Flu Files 

While at first glance it may seem that the only commonality today‚Äôs society has with 1918 is the fact that both were host to infamous pandemics. It is natural to assume that in 2020 the numerous scientific advancements and technological achievements have equipped the world today better than those in 1918. However, this assumption is false. In fact, an analysis of a Chicago Tribune article from October 6, 1918, shows that society has been reacting the same to pandemics over a century later. 

The article analyzed was written by Dr. W.A.Evans, titled Flu Causes and Cure Analyzed by Dr. W.A.Evans (Evans 1918). Right away similarities between then and today are discussed in the precautions section of the article. The precautions warn to stay away from the sick, from crowds, and to stay in well-ventilated areas, similar to what experts stated today. It is eyeopening to read that even in 1918, it was understood how diseases are easily transmitted through close contact. An interesting takeaway from the article is the claim it makes to ease the reader‚Äôs nerves. It claims that while this disease is serious, but goes on to downplay it by stating pneumonia still kills more people every year. This irony is similar to how today, people downplay Covid-19 by stating the common flu kills more people a year. This shows that over a century later, we have a natural tendency to self soothe in this manner. 

The article goes on to recommend that everyone should medicate with Salicylates. This is derived from salicylic acid and used to make aspirin. However, this proved to be a deadly recommendation. A 2009 Medical article found that these aspirin regimens may have contributed to worsening the disease. These high doses of salicylic acid caused fluid retention in the lungs, hyperventilation, and pulmonary edema, worsening the chances of survival (Starko 2009). These regimens were heavily endorsed by medical professionals and the media. This recommendation and this article immediately precede the October death spike, demonstrating that there may be a direct cause and effect relation between the two (Starko 2009). This is similar to how today,  President Trump endorsed the use of Hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 treatment without it being based on actual research and people believed it. This shows that during times of high anxiety, people are willing to try any means to ensure their survival, especially when it comes from an authority figure. 

Additionally, it is surprising to see that this article states to take these recommendations with a grain of salt. These precautions will not be wholly effective and many people will contract the virus. The main reason to take these steps is to ensure hospitals and staff are not overwhelmed (Evans 1918). This is the exact goal of the precautions we take today. It was understood then that if our hospitals are over capacity, there is no way to overcome the pandemic. This puts on full display that while this was understood in 1918, we have made no steps to enforce this vital step. 

In 1918, masks were recommended and were effective which is why we still use them today. We also learned to stop using Dover‚Äôs opioid powder to treat pandemics and illnesses (Evans 1918). Despite this progress, society as a whole is still repeating vital mistakes. This article proves that history does repeat itself and if we do not begin learning from the past, this pandemic will never go away.

                                Before the lockdown, life seemed so ''normal''. Who knew the new norm would be to wear a mask, carry a hand sanitizer at all times and maintain a six feet distance from others. After being told that everyone has to quarantine from going outside to staying indoors all day. Most importantly, everything became remote. Therefore classes and being overwhelmed by work while not being able to go outside was really taking a toll on my physical and mental health. What gave me a ‚Äò‚Äôray of hope‚Äô‚Äô was strangely enough my window. I never thought that looking outside of a window would show me what life has come to and what tomorrow has to offer. Every time I would feel anxious, overwhelmed and in need of a breather I would walk myself to my window. I would just look outside and see the vacant streets. Though it was making me feel ungrateful for how I used to never enjoy looking outside the window, when the children would occupy it. As looking outside my window became a habit I came to realize what didn't change before Covid-19 and now. What did change is the beautiful birds chirping, the beautiful weather, and the rising sun and sunset ensuring yet another day and hope. It is hard to be optimistic at such times but my window made me appreciative of the things I used to take for granted. Such as going outside for a stroll or taking a moment to just appreciate the smallest things around me. Looking outside my window did ensure another day. It endured me just like how the sun and singing birds things will change and indeed for the better. Yeah the sun goes down and the birds leave for their nest but to return for the next day. I've made this a ritual of a sort to walk by my window and take a moment and to be appreciative for what today has to offer. We may not be living in the best of times but tomorrow we'll look back and tell the tales of quarantine and covid-19 to our children and perhaps our grandchildren.

                                My project sought to examine and  understand the historical resilience of Black motherhood and its relation to the life altering pandemic, COVID-19 and racially driven uprisings against systematic oppression; How Black motherhood and resistance through Black motherhood adapted,  how it‚Äôs changed and what new radical resistance through motherhood was conjured in face of the pandemic and race clarity. As an autoethnographic account this research project was centered around my experience of motherhood and communal connections, as well as the experiences of Black mothers and birth workers. The political positioning of Black mothers was considered through essays and poetry written, as well as photos during the lockdowns in relation to the concepts of birth and death, the idea of radical mothering and activism, and the umbrella term of community.

                                I created this powem after a video I took during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. The Las Vegas Strip was desolate of travelers from all over the country. This was something our city hasn't seen in years- possibly since September 11, 2001? Even then, I am not sure it was as silent as it was that night. I based a couple of the lines on the soft breeze in the background of the video I shot.

And for me and many others, it feels like a lifetime ago because so much has happened this year. Many of us have had to grieve the loss of loved ones or our lives before the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù. There‚Äôs been so much uncertainty with COVID-19, the economy, the 2020 election, and even our plans for next week. I was really struck by all of the comments accompanied with this video. And it really interests me how we turn to particular habits or media to cope with loss, uncertainty, and trauma. I feel like Tik Tok is a significant facet of 2020, especially for young adults and teenagers.",,,,,

Although we talk all the time, and are a part of each other daily lives interviewing her in this kind of almost formal format and asking her very pointed questions that I don't typically ask was a bit eye opening. I already knew a lot of what she said, but to hear it all laid out and not intertwined and in bits between the busyness our lives really opened my eyes to how much our lives has had to change because of COVID-19, even as we continue to chug along. I think this is important to know because so often we're bogged down with continuing to go though the motions and check boxes we forget to slow down and think about the circumstances of out situation with COVID.",,,,,

                                Around the date that this image was taken was when the initial wave of COVID-19 began. I chose this image to best reflect my experience with COVID-19 because this was also around the time with the George Floyd shootings. As such, this document was handy for various reasons. For one, being an African-American male was a very unique experience at the time, since Floyd‚Äôs shooting brought about both people who supported either the BLM movement or was against it. The connection with COVID-19 was that during that point in time during the Floyd shooting, COVID-19 was not the main headline.  However, as a consequence to the protests and COVID, curfews were put in place in various states nationwide. This image helped protect me from any unnecessary confrontation that could occur after curfew hours. During a time where there was already enough tension between African-Americans and law enforcement, I did not want to put myself in a situation where I could be compromised. 

In addition, this image will go down in history for future generations to see of the overall impact that COVID-19 had globally. This pandemic made drastic changes to the way of life in which we lived ‚Äì from curfews to furloughing employees, to food and toilet paper shortages. This image reminds me of my experience with COVID-19.

It touches on multiple issues facing Broadway actors, such as the recent deaths of Nick Cordero and Terrence McNally due to complications from COVID-19, the strain on the Actor's Fund due to the financial aid needed by unemployed actors, and how actors are continuing to try to perform during the pandemic. The end even touches on the Black Lives Matter movement and its possible implications on Broadway.",,,,,

We had never really used the balcony, or the apartment for that matter, but it was a safe place where we could regain our sanity at the end of the day, together.

""The Communists in Russia were not able to shut down Tomchei Temimim, and COVID-19 won‚Äôt shut it down either. The challenge today is different, but the mission remains the same, in what is surely Tomchei Temimim‚Äôs final frontier before Moshiach‚Äôs arrival. The Rebbe Rashab, the Frierdiker Rebbe, the Rebbe, and all the Temimim of old are looking to us, the final generation of Temimim, to carry the baton over the finish line.



To that end, YG Melbourne resumed full Seder today via online platforms Zoom and Google Classroom, with the aim of supporting each Bochur in keeping a regular full day of Seder. Instead of reducing Torah study, YG‚Äôs full-service virtual Zal resumed Seder two days ahead of schedule. Seder was also opened up to all Bochurim enrolled in overseas Yeshivos who are stranded in Australia due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.""

                                Melbourne Jewish Book Week was raring to go with its 2020 Festival, scheduled for 2-7 May.

International and local writers were booked ‚Äì more than 80 in total. Almost two years in the planning, the festival was going to include two full days of panels and workshops; opening and closing night galas; a performance at fortyfivedownstairs; a literary brunch with two leading writers from New York; and a keynote address.

As coronavirus spread, and governments started imposing restrictions, including the closure of borders, we held several meetings and on 12 March we decided that a live festival was not in the interests of our supporters ‚Äì and we pulled the plug, with tears and heartache. We were one of the first festivals to do so, but in the days and weeks that followed, no-one had any other option.

We felt an obligation to our supporters, sponsors and writers to provide an alternative. We opted for regular on-line events using available technology, and decided not to commit to a live event until the heath risks were well and truly passed.

Six months later, we are delighted and proud of what we have achieved in the CoVid world. Starting with no knowledge of the technology, we are now familiar with all aspects of Zoom. We have established the second Tuesday of the month as Melbourne Jewish Book Week evening.

Our offerings (to March 2021) have been:

                                Back in March 2020, when we were first placed under quarantine, I was scared. I decided that in order  to protect myself and the ones I care about, that it was better to stay home. I got my food delivered, if I had to go out, I made sure that I had my 'N95' mask, face sheild and gloves, took all the necessary precautions. Towards the ended of may, when the police shooting started happening again. I realized that even though we are in a pandemic the world hasn't stopped moving like I had, people were fighting for their brothers, sister, and families lives. They weren't fighting for better health care nor more food. They were risking their lives to protest against police brutality in their communities, and everywhere in the world. For the first time in months, I choose to get up and leave my little street, and join the people who were fighting for Black Lives. I found this so interesting, because no one could have told me that I would be marching through NYC during a pandemic. I wasn't only risking my health by protesting, but also my life. I'd seen the news showing the violent protests, cops body slamming people, tear gas in the air, and most importantly people showing solidarity to fight for what was right. And that when I realized time doesn't stop, because you do.

                                In late January, most people around me considered Covid-19 to be the next ""avian flu"".  It was not taken as a serious threat at the time and I even remember my colleagues having a ""corona"" party on the roof of our building where we all drank corona and made jokes, as we unknowingly awaited the worst pandemic in a century.



As the months went on and things seemed to escalate daily, I tried as hard as I could to resist going anywhere that required a mask.  I couldn't fully accept all of this and really only left my house to run or take walks, I was working from home and could order groceries or food at any time of day or night so it was an easy thing for me to reject at the time.  Eventually I had to give in because I needed to occasionally stop by the office so I ordered some nice black cloth masks that could house HEPA filters.  It took much getting use to but wasn't terrible wearing the masks and as I began to venture out more and more, it started to become routine.  I'm on my way out, grab my sunglasses, keys and now mask, all which are kept in the same decorative bin on a table next to my front door.  Come home, throw keys and mask into bin, place sunglasses on the table.  Leave, grab keys and mask and sunglasses, come home, put keys and mask into the bin, sunglasses folded neatly alongside.  Every day same thing, until it is something that I no longer thought about or consciously did.  



One day, on my quarter mile walk to the office, I smelled cinnamon.  I looked around but in that part of the city there wasn't a bakery or coffee shop within a few feet, didn't see anyone walk by me and couldn't even understand how I was smelling such a strong aroma through a cloth mask with a filter.  I started to realize that I couldn't even remember the last thing that I had smelled while wearing this mask, so this was definitely unusual.  But like many of our fleeting daily thoughts it was just that, and by the time that I was in the elevator my mind was busy on other things.  I come home, keys and mask in the bin, sunglasses on the table.  Leave the next day, grab mask, keys, sunglasses and walk to work.  I stop at a coffee shop on the way and again...cinnamon.  Instantly I‚Äôm taken back to the previous day and asking myself, ‚Äúwas this what you smelled yesterday?‚Äù, but quickly realizing that I didn‚Äôt go this direction, so I hadn‚Äôt walked by this place.  I get to work and again its forgotten quickly.  Come home, wake up, leave for work, come home, every day the same routine and many of those days, not all though, I had at some point smelled cinnamon.  Finally, one day I came home and entered the house extremely distracted, having a work conversation on my phone while fumbling with my keys and trying to take off my sunglasses off at the same time.  The phone started to slip as I was approaching the ‚Äúdrop off table‚Äù and in my haste to catch the phone I dropped everything else onto the floor.  Sometimes life forces you to slow down and this was one of those times because this was probably the first time in weeks that I was just standing next to this table and focusing.  In the bin, where the masks and keys go is a stick like, brown bundle of something that first appeared to be a dehydrated plant.  I picked it up and immediately could smell that thick, rich cinnamon flavor and connected dozens of fleeting, scattered thoughts to their final conclusion.  My girlfriend had bought some decorative, fall scented potpourri, placed it into this bin and every day the inside of my cloth mask slept on that cinnamon bundle. 



My brain will never again associate the rich smell of cinnamon with fall or desserts, but now will think of masks and a global pandemic.  It seems like it could be a long time before my brain can break this association and have return this spice to its proper neural connection, but sadly wearing masks is now the thing that feels normal to me.  If there is any positive take away to all of this for me, its that I often realize that we are probably living through notable history right now, something that will be remembered and written about for a long time.  Being that I love history and in much of what I read I usually stop and think ‚Äúwhat was that really like in XXX place at XXX time? I wish that I could have seen it‚Ä¶‚Äù, I try to keep perspective and realize that one day in 100 years someone will be wondering the same thing about right now.",,,,,

                                This article from Canada highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting both music majors in college and students in public school and Catholic school who attend music classes. It outlines many of the adjustments being made for music programs, such as colleges restricting voice, woodwind, and brass lessons to being online. Public schools have banned singing in school, as singing has been deemed a high-risk activity. This really highlights how the pandemic may affect performing arts long-term, as college and high-school students may not be able to receive face-to-face training or recital experience depending on their choice of instrument.",,,,,

                                This is a news regarding how they opened up DisneyLand and DisneySea after four months of closing. In general, everyone seemed very happy to open up and all the staff were following CDC guidelines. Personally I felt a little confused because there are still people suffering from COVID and opening themeparks just did not seem necessary at the moment.

Translation:

Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea, which had been closed due to the spread of the new Coronavirus, reopened for the first time in about four months on the 1st of July.



At Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea, which have been reopened, the number of visitors will be reduced to about half and only for those who purchased a ticket with a specified date in advance.



Visitors: ""I'm so happy. I've been waiting for 4 months ... I'm crying. I've been patient for 4 months so I feel like I'm back in my dream world."" ""I'm so happy just to come to the park today. I want to have fun ""



After taking preventive measures such as temperature measurement, it will be open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm for the time being.",,,,,

Despite the global pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement saw a resurgence after the murder of American George Floyd in May of this year. Protests were sparked all over the world, pushing for the action to end the systematic racism experienced by people of colour (POC) and indigenous people all around the globe. I took this screen recording on my phone when, on June 2nd of this year, people all over the world participated in what was called ‚ÄòBlackout Tuesday‚Äô, where they would post black squares to their instagram account in an effort to project the voices of those who experience the systematic racism. I follow many celebrities on instagram, which you can see in this video many participated in the movement. However, the effort was quickly criticised, as the masses of posts featuring the black square began to dominate the Black Lives Matter (BLM) hashtag on all social media, an important tool that had been used by many to organise and publicise protests all over the world. Instead of the intended goal of projecting black voices over their white counterparts, the black squares instead silenced the important information that was being spread through the hashtag, doing the opposite of the intended effect.",,,,,

If we aren't follwing this value of eqauilty we are forsure on the right path because slavery historycally was just a little while back.

                                These two documents contain the responses to the Cultural Institutions and COVID-19: Anonymous Survey. 

This survey was undertaken with the support and assistance of Juilee Decker, at A Journal of the Plague Year, in order to capture the experiences of those working in museums and other cultural institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to a combination of furloughs and layoffs as a direct result of COVID-19 lockdowns, and conversations around racial justice in the light of this year‚Äôs Black Lives Matter protests, museums and other cultural institutions have been facing an unprecedented reckoning, in terms of workers‚Äô rights and racial justice. This survey asked individuals how this year‚Äôs events have impacted them, as well as their perceptions of the cultural sector, focusing specifically on those issues of workers‚Äô rights and racial justice.

All responses were collected through the Cultural Institutions and COVID-19: Anonymous Survey website (https://covidmuseumsanonymous.wordpress.com/), between July and October, 2020. This website was further advertised through an Instagram account, found here: https://www.instagram.com/covidmuseumsanonymous/ . The survey had 107 respondents, with 97 giving permission to have their responses published publicly.",,,,,

While I don't touch on numbers in the video, it's mainly to give an idea from the average person's point of view.

                                In the six months Maria Ch√°vez‚Äôs husband has been detained at La Palma Correctional Center, he has been quarantined twice after being exposed to suspected cases of COVID-19.



And quarantine, for him, has meant solitary confinement. Andr√©s gets 20 minutes a day outside his cell, Ch√°vez said, which he first uses to call his wife of 29 years and family. He uses the remaining time to shower.



‚ÄúAny normal person would get depressed in quarantine, locked up for almost 24 hours a day,‚Äù Ch√°vez said in Spanish. ‚ÄúFor those of us on the outside, it‚Äôs different. But for the person that‚Äôs inside, it‚Äôs enough to drive you crazy.‚Äù



La Palma, which can house up to 3,060 detainees, is one of two privately run Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Eloy, Arizona. The other, Eloy Detention Center, can hold up to 1,456 people.



At the end of July, there were 252 positive COVID-19 cases at Eloy and 108 positive cases in La Palma. Among the roughly 4,000 detainees who had tested positive for the virus as of late July, ICE data showed Eloy Detention Center had the third-highest number of positive cases in the country, after facilities in Washington, D.C., and Texas.



Migrant rights activists suspect official numbers don‚Äôt tell the full story ‚Äî given the lack of comprehensive testing at detention facilities, they say, it‚Äôs likely COVID-19 has sickened or infected many more detainees. But officials from ICE and CoreCivic, which owns and operates both Eloy facilities, have defended their handling of the pandemic, saying they‚Äôve relied on federal guidelines to protect employees and ‚Äúthose entrusted to our care.‚Äù



Lawsuits filed throughout the country argue those measures have fallen short. Migrant advocacy groups say the facilities‚Äô poor ventilation and small, enclosed spaces put detainees ‚Äî many of whom are seeking asylum in the United States ‚Äî at high risk of contracting COVID-19.



They contend release is the ‚Äúonly appropriate remedy.‚Äù

                                The pandemic was the least of my worries as a freshman in college who was still adjusting, but it soon overtook my life. Not only did I not come back from spring break, but the entire university shifted to online learning as it was too unsafe to be in class. I left my perfectly curated dorm, my professors, and friends to something that I had not given ten minutes of my time a month prior. The pandemic had been looming in the background and I had heard about it and never really thought it would affect me but I was very wrong. The virus changed my view of schooling, the way the government looks at its citizens and how we treat one another. During the initial lockdown I observed many ways in which everyone tried to cope with our reality. There were those making banana bread, sourdough bread, and binging tv shows on Netflix such as Tiger King. Then there were the college and high school kids who were all staying up till the early hours of the morning mindlessly scrolling through social media, more specifically TikTok, since there was no school to wake up early for. Now I understand that social media can be, and is toxic, but the app TikTok has made a relatively good space for all people and has proven to be a  good way to spread information to a younger generation rapidly. As someone who had only a few months ago been writing papers and doing homework in my dorm I can without a doubt say I would never have envisioned myself on an app watching 30 or 60 second videos for hours on end. The videos on the app are comedy related, informative on niche topics, activism, such as the Black Lives Matter Protests, political and just about everything under the sun. Although it is only an app that could vanish at any moment, it has become part of millions of college and high school students' lives. It has offered a distraction from all of the uncertainty in the world and an outlet to share their experiences. I personally attempted to make a TikTok with my friends as we kept six feet apart from each other and although it never turned out it still offered a distraction from the fact that we were not able to just go to one another's houses and hang out - we had to meet in our old high school parking lot. The app seems so benign to those who are not on it, but from what I have seen it has offered happiness in a time of world turmoil.

                                This article covers what is happening in the fine dining industry during Covid-19. All restaurants are dealing with the pandemic and the loss of revenue. Many fine dining restaurants are closing because the cost margins are so narrow and for these restaurants to stay in business they need a full house. It also highlights the decision making that David Chang had to process and look out for the well-being of his employees if they did take-out and delivery. #foodislife, #davidchang #momofuku, #covid19 (Arizona State University, HST 580)",,,,,

                                I live in California, and during this pandemic we have also been dealing with devastating wildfires. The pollution from these fires has been very concerning for me. Noticing that all the air purifiers were sold out and me wanting to save money, I found a ""lifehack"" to make a homemade one with a box fan and air filter. It worked like a charm and was more effective than most luxury models. While I no longer have to deal with the smell of wildfires in my apartment, the constant hum of this contraption is a constant reminder of how climate change is destroying California.

                                I refused to let Covid-19 ruin my favorite day of the year‚ÄîHalloween. It only took a little extra work to ensure I could enjoy it safely with my friends and neighbors. First, I went on Amazon and found an inflatable dinosaur costume which covered my entire body and face. Next, I prepackaged all the Halloween candy into little baggies while wearing a mask and gloves. I set up a six foot table in my front yard where I set out a few treats at a time.



The evening started off slow with only a handful of trick-or-treaters stopping by before heading out to local socially distanced Halloween events. However, when the sun went down more trick-or-treaters emerged. From adults to small children, everyone was masked up. During a normal Halloween in my neighborhood, multiple families would pile into one car and cruise the neighborhood together. This time the groups were much smaller. The kids were younger too. Many parents didn‚Äôt want their little ones to miss out on the festivities.



Overall, Halloween turned out much better than I expected this year. My costume provided much needed laughter at work, and my neighbors enjoyed taking pictures of their kids with a giant blue dinosaur.",,,,,

                                This essay was produced as a part of the American Studies program at California High School in San Ramon, California. The essay is in response to the prompt ""Is America currently living up to its core values?"" This essay argues that America is currently not living up to one of its key values, equality, because of the racial disparity and gender inequality that still happen in today‚Äôs society. For example, there is still police brutality against black Americans and the Pink Tax. People now are protesting against these issues and bringing light to inequality in America, especially in support of black Americans.",,,,,

                                I wanted to include these news articles about an event that happened in my community. 287 workers at JBS meatpacking plant tested positive for COVID-19 at the beginning of Summer 2020. 

I am ~somewhat~ familiar with this meatpacking plant. When I attended Mountain Crest High School in Hyrum, I ran cross country and one of our running routes required us to pass this building. I usually did not like this route because the smell combined with running often made me nauseous. I believe it was bought or acquired since my running days by JBS because we used to refer to this place as ‚ÄúMiller‚Äôs‚Äù.

Fast forward about nine years later when these news articles were published. This was the first huge outbreak in Cache Valley. It took some time before COVID-19 hit Northern Utah. Yeah, I think we had a few cases here and there. But it always felt ‚Äúmanageable‚Äù to me before this event. But with this outbreak, I began feeling unsafe in my corner of the world.

I was especially upset at the injustice of this situation because most of the workers at JBS were Hispanic/Latinx. It felt like no measures, like paid leave or free testing services, were being taken to protect these workers. According to a Bear River Health Department report for June 1, 2020, Hispanic/Latinx accounted for more than 40% of COVID cases. Yet, only about 10% of the population here is Hispanic/Latinx. I strongly feel that this is because of JBS. 

I feel frustrated living here in Utah during the pandemic. So many people do not care about the situation we are in. Meanwhile, there are people who make sacrifices by working on the ‚Äúfront lines‚Äù. For the Hispanic/Latinx community in Cache Valley, it doesn‚Äôt feel like a voluntary sacrifice. But rather, another example of unfair systemic racism. Meanwhile, it seems so trivial and unjust that my community still insisted on having a county fair and little league baseball this year. I understand the economic consequences and reasons why people are hesitant to take precautions in certain situations. It is complicated and we don‚Äôt really have a great safety net for people in America. That being said, I hate seeing the flippant attitudes while people are literally dying. 

This weekend, we reached a record spike in COVID cases in Utah. And Election Day is this week. I feel so anxious all the time. And I am trying to reach for some peace wherever I can find it. I really hope that soon we will start taking this pandemic seriously.",,,,,

Breonna Taylor deserves justice regardless of what's going on in the world. As you can see, protestors are staying safe with precautionary measures such as gloves, masks, etc. becuase they are not just combatting diseases or viruses; there prepared for police brutality. I would like to take my turn to salute my people for always striving for what's right and for going about it the right way.

                                I remember when quarantine first started, I was miserable. I hated the idea of being stuck in the house. But I used quarantine as a time for me to stay positive and work on becoming a better me. With staying positive I had a better mindset throughout the day and found ways to keep me motivated. I was upset at first with a bunch of my activities being cancelled but I did find positive alternatives. With this it has definitely lifted my spirits and made me have more of a positive outlook on the cancellation of certain things and on life moving forward.

was one of a few who were taking pictures of the crowd. I believe the image has a lonely quality

to it, given the empty windows, lone figure, and grey clouds. Loneliness has been a key factor in

the pandemic, and this gets that across fairly well. It also shows the social turmoil going on

underneath, both in its context of the establishment surveying the protest going on below, and

the imagery of the authority of these times standing atop a building that seems hollow on a

faded world.",,,,,

                                This is a video that has surfaced on Instagram the night of November 5th. Hurricane Eta has hit Honduras bring flooding and catastrophic damage to the country. This is a video of Toncot√≠n, Tegucigalpa's International Airport. This video is alarming for many St. Mary's International Students from Honduras because of the implications this destruction has on their future. For many students studying remotely in Honduras,  this means that they may not be able to come to the United States to study next semester, and for those on campus, it means they may not be able to return home in December. With all the uncertainty that the pandemic has caused, this hurricane has created yet another enormous challenge.

                                As a second-year graduate student in the History MA program at Arizona State University, I found myself enrolling in the HST 580: Professional Experience course after viewing an online announcement outlining the unique experience of a remote internship. With prior experience as a digital archivist with the National Archives and Records Administration, the Smithsonian Institute, and the California Digital Newspaper Collection, in addition to years spent as an undergraduate research assistant at the UCLA Center for Korean Studies digitizing reels of microfilm, I initially believed this internship to be hours of busywork without much substance. I was quickly proven wrong, however. Unlike the previous archives mentioned, A Journal of the Plague Year is a living and breathing archive, recording stories as they occur. This constant fluctuation resulting from live submissions created a dynamic, and sometimes turbulent, workspace that required interns to possess flexibility, problem-solving, and innovation skills.



Far from my initial understanding of the internship, the archive provided curatorial interns with a wide-ranging set of skills applicable in any professional environment. Using Omeka-S, Otter.ai, and Slack, interns learned to enhance accessibility to historical documents by curating and transcribing crowdsourced items into a searchable resource. Curatorial interns carefully handled thousands of photographs, articles, and recordings, while assisting with branding, legal compliance, and writing for diverse platforms. Through archival collaborations with international universities and institutions, interns were able to advance their communication skills to convey necessary, time-sensitive, and fluctuating information concerning the live curation of items.



This interactive and innovative internship challenged my understanding of public history and pushed me to appreciate the archival process in a new light. As calls for submissions urged individuals to share their everyday experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic, I recognized the importance of documenting daily happenings and confronting historical silences. As a result, A Journal of the Plague Year reignited my determination to support rural K-12 students and ensure that their stories are documented alongside their urban and suburban counterparts. While I have no immediate plans to become a public historian, I have learned an innumerable amount of skills that will surely advance my career in the educational sector.",,,,,

                                Governor Charles Baker issued this executive order making 14-day quarantines for out-of-state travelers mandatory on July 24, 2020, in a departure from the advisory ""order"" declared in March asking travelers to either quarantine or avoid the commonwealth all together.  This order exempts seven Northeastern states whose COVID levels had been deemed ""low-risk,"" but required all out-of-state travelers from the remaining 43 states, and returning residents, to self-isolate or obtain a negative test result 72 hours prior to arrival.  Failure to meet these guidelines carried with it a penalty of a $500/day fine; a feature that was absent from the earlier travel advisory guidelines.  With Massachusetts having seen improvement from the springtime surge that left tens of thousands of residents infected and over 8,000 dead, the Commonwealth sought to stay ahead of the virus curve and squelch an expected resurgence, as tens of thousands of returning students from across the country prepared to descend upon greater Boston colleges and universities in the fall.",,,,,

                                We don't know when this will all be over. Those may be the hardest words to hear.



We spend most of our lives planning around calendars and clocks, schedules, seasons, schooldays, holidays, ETAs, projections and informed predictions.



I try not to compare any other tests in life to war. But because I've covered wars and conflicts, I think I recognize what many people in places like Sarajevo, Asmara, or Afghanistan always told me: it is not just the danger, but the uncertainty of not knowing when a crisis, the hardship, loss, and peril, will be over.



The coronavirus is now much more widespread than it was in March, when many of us began to count the weeks; which have become months; and now will clearly stretch into next year. Scientists have learned a lot about the virus, and refined treatments. But words we've sometimes used to try to get hold of what's happening may have put wrong metaphors into our minds. Wave is not quite right, because the coronavirus won't swell, then just fall, like an ocean wave. Surge is not quite right because at this point, more than eight months into the pandemic, the rise in cases is not sudden, but continuous. Many places, countries and states, that thought they had seen the worst, done the best, and moved on are again overwhelmed with new cases, and more losses. Each week, we learn more about people who no longer test positive for the virus but continue to struggle with prolonged symptoms of COVID-19, including shortness of breath, endless fatigue, and a kind of brain fog.



It is hard to have patience when we know, every day, of so many precious lives lost too soon. What may give glimpses of hope, though, is the work of people in so many places who mask up each day to keep life going: health care workers, bus and truck drivers, people who work in fields and stores, teachers and construction crews, and those who deep-clean the places where others work, including the very studio I'm in now.



We may not be able to defeat, overwhelm, or kick the coronavirus in the backside ‚Äî more metaphors that now fall flat. But each day, we can help each other, and rise above fatigue and despair. We can wear masks, stay a social distance apart, avoid big gatherings, look for chances to make each other laugh, and help each other keep going, until that time when the masks we wear today can become souvenirs, instead of survival gear.",,,,,

                                After the Obama administration intervened in Libya and removed Muammar al-Gaddafi; Libya's entire infrastructure of hospitals, emergency services, and universities became totally decimated by US airstrikes. Libya is currently experiencing a civil war post-United States intervention and it has left the population in a refugee crisis. The country most likely would have been able to handle the COVID-19 pandemic considering they had arguably the best healthcare and university systems in Africa pre US intervention. 



However, it is good to see the US and UN donating money to help the war-torn country currently experiencing civil war and total humanitarian collapse. The money is being given to the US-installed regime so it will be interesting to see how it is spent. Ironically in a country that was totally decimated its oil enterprises are back online and producing crude, which before the US intervention, the money went to the people first, but now is being divided up by BP, Shell, and the US installed regime.",,,,,

                                This image represents the disruption that COVID-19 brought upon the daily lives of members in American society. Additionally, it could be used to symbolize the calm before the storm. The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 and almost immediate initiation of mandatory quarantine was chaotic enough. However, extended seclusion and cruel cops triggered a violent uproar within the hearts and actions of civilians. Within the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, American society has endured an almost complete shut down of businesses, initiation of new safety procedures, protests for black lives matter, protests for blue lives matter, anti-mask protestors, virtual school, the daily life of wearing a mask constantly while in public, toilet paper crises, the loss of loved ones, earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and much more.

                                In late August of 2020, I traveled from Fort Myers, Florida, to New York City. The pandemic affected the economy and travel extensively. For everyone's safety and to prevent damage to the economy, travel was allowed but restricted. As a result, prices for flights dropped, and my brother and I took advantage to visit our father, whom we had not seen in over a year. The airport seemed empty; however, when we boarded, the plane was full of people. We received care packages before boarding that contained alcohol wipes and hand sanitizer. Luckily for us, when we arrived in New York City, restrictions for COVID-19 in the city began to die down. Business' began opening, but most of the people who left their homes only went to work. Aside from a few individuals, the streets seemed dead. The streets pre-pandemic was full of life and culture. COVID ‚Äì19 appeared to have stolen all that made the city vibrant.   



New York City is infamous for its subway rats, but what my family and I saw on a walk-through Central Park one day changed our perspective on them forever. We saw many rats running around the park freely. Usually, they will not run away at the sight of a person; they mostly do not care. But this time, they tried to get closer, almost as if they were grateful to see people. The foot traffic dramatically decreasing in New York forced the rats to move. They had to find an area where they could live freely, have food, and drink sources. Therefore, subway rats made the abandoned streets and paths of Central Park their new home. The manufactured rivers at the park made an excellent water hole. People regularly come to the park to feed other animals; birds, ducks, turtles, and squirrels are just a few. Because of this convenient food source, rats took advantage. They began to crowd around other animals hoping to receive food as well. Nonetheless, it seemed their relationship evolved past survival.  We witnessed the animals at play. One would chase the other and vice versa. At one point, we found birds, squirrels, and rats eating together at the hand of a generous woman. The animals, abandoned by humans, began to come together, and in silence, the city gleamed with beauty. 



My trip to New York City in the year 2020 post-COVID-19 was unforgettable. The effects of the virus were visible in more than just the individual. It affected the economy, the culture, and the way of life for many organisms. The city quickly adjusted to the circumstances in hopes of survival. The resilience animals have as a community, their survival tactics, and prevalence are admirable features historians will appreciate when studying the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on society. Personally, seeing how COVID-19 forced the city that never sleeps to take a nap is a once in a lifetime experience.",,,,,

                                This email was sent out to the St. Mary‚Äôs University community on July 7, 2020, to explain the three different formats in which courses would be offered for the Fall 2020 semester. The university would offer three different formats for the then-upcoming semester. 



The first format offered was online courses (OL). These courses were not taught in person, but they still follow a syllabus and have course deadlines. They could include pre-recorded lectures, video uploads, class chats, and individual meetings with professors. 



The next course format offered was Virtual (V). These courses would meet at an appointed time and date, similar to a normal in-person class, but on the Zoom conference platform, and they would be led by a professor who could be teaching from a variety of different environments. They would not meet in person or on campus, just virtually. Similar to online courses these courses might also include class chats, video recordings, and one on one meetings with professors.



The last course format offered was In-Person Virtual (IPV). These courses were designed as hybrid courses. Students would be able to attend these courses in person in a traditional classroom environment (though class size would be limited), or they could attend the class virtually through Zoom. 



All of the course formats described above were offered by my university in response to the COVID19 pandemic, and they demonstrate the need for adaptation and change in the era of COVID19. The author of this post has been able to attend both virtual and in-person virtual classes at St. Mary‚Äôs University this semester. Speaking from firsthand experience, I can attest to how different being in the classroom is this semester. There are not a lot of students in the class; at most maybe three students on any given day. Those of us in the classroom, students, and teachers, sit in socially distanced seats, and we all have our masks up. Regardless, I am grateful that I have had the chance to try to forge a new normal for myself during such an abnormal time for our university and our world.",,,,,

                                I joined the Journal of the Plague Year as an intern my first semester of graduate school, throwing myself into the fray with gusto. I learned about the archive from Dr. Kole when we had our first Zoom meeting to discuss my program of study for Global History. She was very excited about the archive. After initially thinking it would be too much for my first semester, I decided I‚Äôd sign up. I‚Äôm very glad I did! This has been a wonderful experience that has connected me to the rest of our intern team in a way I don‚Äôt think many online students get. Weekly Zoom meetings have fostered our little community and spurred us to do more for our collections. 



This internship gave me the opportunity to develop my skills with communication, writing, and the curatorial process. I never thought I‚Äôd write a press release or conduct an oral history interview. Having done both, I can say I‚Äôve moved pretty far outside of my comfort zone. I‚Äôm incredibly thankful for the opportunity to hold real responsibility, learn new skills, and create a collection that I care about. I‚Äôve been pushed out of my comfort zone enough during this time that I feel that I‚Äôve grown as a person, and I feel more confident knowing my peers and leaders trusted me to take care of what needed to be done. I‚Äôve learned a lot not only about public history, but about academia and networking within our team. Coming from a work background entirely different from history, it has been a great chance to get to know people within this realm of expertise. It‚Äôs also given me a much wider view of the stories and experiences of people throughout the world as we deal with this crisis than I would have had without it. 



The Over 60 collection has been very important to me, if somewhat difficult to find direct voices for. I hope that future interns will want to continue my work on this collection as work on the archive continues. We all have older friends and relatives who we care deeply about. Documenting the unique struggles of one of the most vulnerable populations is incredibly important when their voices can often be lost in the noise of everything else.",,,,,

                                On Saturday 11 April 2020, a group of Jews from across Australia gathered together on zoom for a 'Solidarity seder'. Organised by people from Here, Queer, and Jewish Australia, Sydney Left Jews, Australian Jewish Democratic Society (AJDS), Fully Automated Luxury Kosher Space Kibbutz and Jews against Fascism, this seder raised money for undocumented migrants as well as Grandmothers Against Removals. 

Approximately 60 people gathered together, reading through the haggadah together, sharing a meal, and sharing ideas about what Jewish life and possibility looked like in that moment. Everyone agreed that this was a unique and special Jewish space.",,,,,

                                The 2020 election is arguably going to one of the most important ones in American History. Not only because of the explosive tension between the two candidates but also because of COVID-19. This invisible enemy has crippled not only our nation but the world. It has forced countries to shut down, leaving economies unstable and politics shaky as ever. In some countries, the virus has brought leaders together. In the U.S, it has deepened the bipartisanship.  

 Rather than reaching across the aisle, both Republicans and Democrats use this pandemic for their political gains. The conversation of COVID has not only a global issue but is also treated as a Presidential Candidate debate topic. The health of our nation is vastly essential; however, politicians do not hesitate to point fingers when numbers continue to rise. Not surprisingly, the most controversial opinion is coming from President Trump, who boldly stated he would be pushing back the Presidential Election. This is not Constitutional legal, nor does he have the power to enforce this. 

 With Americans eager to vote for the upcoming election, we are faced with the following predicament; how do we ensure our voters' safety? Many leaders are leaning and enforcing, state by state mail-in ballots. Eligible voters are mailed ballots before the official election day and send it back to the appropriate party. However, even with this solution, there has been push back from Washington. Currently, the Trump administration has cut funding for the United States Postal Office. In an interview, he ""frankly acknowledged that he's starving the postal service of that money to make it harder to process an expected surge of mail-in ballots"" (Riccardi, N. 2020). Studies have shown that Democrats are more willing to vote via mail. With this, Trump is taking every precaution to slow the Democratic wave that is approaching the White House. Obama, who is usually silent during politics, has called Trump out for financially starving the postal service.  

 Not only is COVID changing the way we vote, but it is also changing the landscape of American Health Care. More than ever, Health Care for all Americans is being supported and pushed onto the next president. When casting their ballot, Americans are now asking themselves, 'who can take care of my family and I best during a pandemic?'. It has been clear that this virus is not going away, and we are expecting another wave. With this in mind, we have to ask who is best suited to guide us through this apocalyptic world.",,,,,

                                I decided to embark on this internship despite no previous experience in public history, and it has afforded me the opportunity to learn many things about the practice of public history and historical collection more broadly. Having worked on the internship in tandem with a fellowship role on the same project had challenged and pushed me in ways I hadn‚Äôt imagined. Having begun the project as a volunteer, a fellow, and then an intern placed me at the apex of an entirely new experience, and is part of my drive to challenge myself, to learn, to be part of something larger than myself, and to grow. In my first semester of graduate school, I became deeply immersed and personally invested in a project that had become bigger than I may have initially anticipated. This project has taught me, among other things: leadership, patience, collaboration, how to be adapt quickly, as well as the concept of shared authority. 



The skills and growth I have received over this journey has been invaluable. In addition to learning important skills and practices relating to history, the internship has given me practical experience in being a leader among my peers, communicating effectively through press releases and social media, and developing effective standardized practices. These skills will be invaluable in whatever I pursue, as well as in my life more broadly. Getting lost in the work of the internship regarding the historical curation of the pandemic, has ironically distracted me from the pandemic itself to an extent, in my personal life. I have paused many times during the course of this internship to reflect on the significance of our work and the significance of this moment in history. The friends and professional relationships I have created through this experience will follow me throughout my life and academic career.",,,,,

                                COVID-19 re-created a living paradigm I had experienced living in Japan for many years of wearing a mask in public, usually on public transportation or during flu season.  Although I did not wear it all the time, when I did wear it my sense of smell would of course be muted, or I would smell my own breath.  It would also bring to my attention what I perceived others would smell when I spoke with them making me more self-conscience of my breath (and increasing gum and mint purchases).  Although I found it uncomfortable, I would deal with it for the short periods of time it was necessary.



When the COVID-19 government responses in the US required the use of a mask in public, I found myself back in unpleasantly familiar sensation of having to wear a mask, but now one made of cloth, since disposable paper ones were hard to acquire or reserved for health care workers.  Of course, said mask has been washed and dried with perfumed detergents further muting the sense of smell.  What also made it worse was the fuzzy lint strings that existed on the inside of any mask (cloth or paper) that would tickle the nose and inducing a sneeze, unleashing a round of stares from strangers nearby.  



Overall, I have grown used to it, but the behavioral shift in wearing, washing, gathering, and staging of a mask that has become a norm, and so has the muted sense of smell.  Sometimes a blessing and sometimes a curse.",,,,,

                                The Caring Mums program is a service providing emotional support to mothers of babies and pregnant women. The program matches trained volunteers, all of whom are mothers themselves, to new mums with the goal of developing a secure trusting relationship. Through regular weekly meetings for up to a period of 12 months, mums‚Äô‚ÄØfeelings of isolation, anxiety‚ÄØand depression decrease, while their parenting confidence and‚ÄØsense of belonging grow significantly.

Caring Mums adapted its program so that its aims and values can still be upheld during the current pandemic. We continue to see mums in our current catchment whilst growing our service into new areas, using technology, as we understand the impact this reality has on vulnerable and isolated populations, including mums‚ÄØalready‚ÄØfacing many new challenges.

Immigrants‚Äù is to analyze the already existing socioeconomic conditions in BIPOC and

immigrant communities that perpetuate mental health stigma and are also causes for the rising

mental health crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research project aims to investigate

generational trauma and its correlation to the pressurizing notion of the ‚Äòessential worker,‚Äô how

the silence of trauma creates stigma, and the lack of representation and affordable mental health

resources for low-income BIPOC and immigrants.

                                This is a video my sister sent me of her first day with the P100 mask. It is a 3D printed mask that a department at her hospital have been making themselves because of the shortage of PPE. Every nurse gets one of these and the filters on them are replaceable (roughly 3 months before replacement filters are needed). They are very tight so nurses apply gel stickers around the seal to prevent bruising. They are so new to the unit that some nurses and techs have been getting bad dermatitis on their skin, so their is still some improvements to be made but because of the severity of the situation comfort is overlooked.",,,,,

                                My story of the Quarantine is that initially I was kind of excited about the prospect of having an excuse to stay indoors. This is due to the fact that I am a homebody and would rather chill with my friends rather than go to parties. However, one thing that I did not think of was that not only would I be staying home most of the time, but a majority of the rest of my family would as well. When I was younger, having everyone home was not a problem, but now we are all grown up, and we all need our space. Due to Quarantine, getting that space that I wanted was rather hard. It felt like I was having a hard time being able to be alone without someone hearing what I was saying. Not only that, but it was also hard because the conflicts in my family came to become more and more prevalent/ This is due to the fact that things like the college process and transitioning from high school to college seemed to have been made a lot harder. Instead of this Summer being relaxing and giving me room to breathe, it was made into one of the hardest times of my life.



The short story titled ""I Have Mouth, and I Must Scream"" by Harlan Ellison captures how I felt during the pandemic. In the story, the characters are trapped underground and are totally helpless to the situation that they find themselves in. In many ways, I felt almost the same way to these characters. I felt like I was trapped in a place that I felt as though I had no control over anything because it was not my domain. Like the narrator of the story, I too felt as though I had no mouth by the end of it all. This is due to the fact that I am not the best at standing up for myself or handling conflicts. Not only that, but I feel like whenever I would try to argue my point, I always felt like nothing would happen. Even if anything did happen that went my way, it always felt like it was not enough to feel like a victory. By the end, it would just reinforce my unwillingness to speak up for myself or to just let things go and allow them to continue. I hope that I will be able to improve things once my time at Suffolk starts and when this Quarantine ends.",,,,,

                                I created this sweet (as in cool) poster to promote the JOTPY Internship and recruit more participants for the fall semester. I love the imagery of hand sanitizer as liquid gold. The fact that it a public mural makes it even more compelling.



I started off with 9 students enrolled in the fall internship. This internship is open to ASU history graduate students. Yet, slowly that number dropped down to four. I‚Äôm not sure why. I don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs a better opportunity out there right now. Nowhere else can you complete a remote internship on the scale of the COVID-19 archive. This archive is magnanimous, it‚Äôs important now, but it will be remembered as a watershed moment in public history projects. 



I do recognize that people are busy, and the fact that the internship goes beyond the normal 7.5 week session is an extra piece to juggle, but in my mind anyone who wants to do public history or gain a serious skill set needs to be part of this project. I hope I can convince more people to join.",,,,,

                                Due to the pandemic, Yom Hashoah commemoration events, which would normally be held in person, needed to go online. 



On April 20, 2020, LaunchPad hosted an online, zoom-based, Yom Hashoah event which ""consisted of an intergenerational conversation exploring the preservation of memory and the ways in which we can each be custodians of our family's stories."" 



At the event there were three speakers: Phillip Maisel (Holocaust survivor), Suzy Zail (2nd Gen) and Julia Sussman (3rd Gen), moderated by Jennifer Levitt Maxwell. 



The event (which went for 45 minutes) also involved candle lighting. Everyone was encouraged to light a candle at home, and then six people were nominated to light 6 candles for the event, namely: Pauline Rockman OAM - co-president of the Jewish Holocaust Centre, Simone Szalmuk-Singer - co-chair of Australian Jewish Funders,¬†Phil and Sue Lewis and their family - co-chair of the Jewish Holocaust Centres capital campaign,¬†Helen Mahemoff - Board Director of the Jewish Holocaust Centre,¬†Arek dybel - filmmaker and creative director at museum POLIN in Warsaw, and Andrea Lipshutz - representing LaunchPad‚Äôs¬†‚ÄòRegeneration Melbourne‚Äô¬†Committee.

                                Businesses across the San Francisco Bay Area have closed, some temporary and some permanently, as a result of California's COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. Those that hope to re-open have boarded up their windows to try to protect their stores and inventory. As a result of the crushing economic blow of the COVID-19 pandemic, the vibrancy of San Francisco streets has vanished. In response, local arts are turning boarded storefronts into beautiful murals with messages of hope. Local artists are ""bringing life and beauty to our streets, sending messages of love to people in their community."" Two local art agencies, Building 180 and Art for Civil Discourse, have teamed up and created Paint the Void. Paint the Void pairs local artists with boarded up businesses in an attempt to beautify the city and ""to bring hope into the community and inspire people."" Artists hope to eventually auction their murals and donate the funds raised to those in need.",,,,,

Gwyn recently graduated from UTSA with an undergraduate degree in Anthropology and classical studies. She is currently in her first year of graduate school and began it entirely online. In the interview, Gwyn described her first semester of graduate school and how her mental health has been impacted by the combination of COVID-19 and transition to online school. 



Gwyn's experience is significant because many students in the fall 2020 semester face various obstacles with maintaining their social lives, productivity with school, and staying physically and mentally healthy.

                                We baptized our son at home in quarantine. I performed a Catholic Baptism using the same text a priest would. He was just 6 months old. As of September 2020 we still have yet to get him officially baptized at a Catholic Church. We thought that this would be the best thing to do given the circumstances, and quite a story to tell. We invited friends, family and godparents via Zoom. We got dressed up and invited everyone to bring a candle. I might later add another file and give more details to this story.",,,,,

                                In this essay, I describe how the U.S. is not currently living up to their American values of equality and unity. The leaders of our country is dividing the country for politics rather than unifying. This is making our country more two sided than ever before. To add on, another American value not given to us is equality. Equality is not given to people in the work place, on the streets, and so many other ways. That is why there are protests and riots all around the United States. BLM movement is doing something to change this. These American values will be given to the people of this country.",,,,,

                                Due to pandemic restrictions, I moved to work remotely in mid-March 2020. While hunkering down, this additional time spent home rather than commuting allowed for additional family time in the evening. My wife, two sons, and I would make it a point to pick up our instruments after dinnertime and sing. One song that grew from our nightly 'concert' was 'Bedtime Band.' I will never forget the little melody we created and our six and four year old playing their little drumset and ukulele. While the pandemic has brought much adversity to many, I'm grateful for the additional time I've spent with my family.

                                The time lapse video shows a little snip-it of how I dealt with quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many businesses were forced to shut down for a few months to ensure everyone's safety was first priority. One of the businesses that were shut down were gyms. I was very saddened by this business shutting down because my physical health is very important to me. Physical health has a lot of affect on mental health as well. To keep my mental health in check during this pandemic, I would workout almost every day so that I didn't let myself go through these months of being quarantined. My best friend came over to my house almost everyday for about an hour to workout in my living room. We worked out together to not only stay in touch during these trying times, but to also keep each other motivated to keep pushing ourselves. The only equipment we had access to were dumbbells and a bench. These two things were all we needed to keep going in our physical strength during these rough couples of months. My friend and I were anxiously waiting for the gym to open back up and while we were working each week still not knowing when the gyms will open again, I kept trying to challenge us. Almost every week I introduced a new workout to our list because sometimes it was so unmotivating to do the same workouts every day. I constantly researched and watched videos of what we can accomplish with just some dumbbells and a bench. We definitely got creative with some of our exercises. Although the pandemic kept us away from the gyms, my friend and I decided early on that our mental and physical health will not deteriorate for these next couple of months and we will give it our all.",,,,,

                                COVID-19 caused St. Mary's University to shut down rapidly on campus after spring break. Most students didn't return after spring break, and had to make later plans to return to get their personal items (including clothes, textbooks, and other items that they may have urgently needed). Some students, who didn't have a place to return to, worked with St. Mary's residence life to make arrangements to remain in the dorms. Students who stayed faced a unique set of challenges and uncertainty with what lay ahead. Combined degree student (undergraduate and graduate) Glory Turnbull, a resident in on campus housing, reflects in this oral history on what these rapid closures of campus meant to them.",,,,,

                                On April 11, 2020, the United States Air Force Thunderbirds flew over each hospital in the Las Vegas Valley from the north to the west to the south and then back to Nellis Air Force Base over the Las Vegas Strip to thank the Covid-19 healthcare workers.  This picture was taken by my father as the Thunderbirds flew over the hospital nearest to me. Some might argue this this flyover and subsequent flyovers in other American cities was a waste of taxpayers‚Äô money. I strongly disagree because it was a way for the heroic men and women of the Thunderbirds to thank the healthcare workers who themselves have been heroes in the battle against Covid-19. This view was best expressed by the commander and leader of the Thunderbirds, Lt. Col. John Caldwell. 

 It is an honor to fly for the Americans at the forefront of our nation‚Äôs fight against the coronavirus. They are true heroes and we look forward to demonstrating the support of the 685,000 total force Airmen of the U.S. Air Force for healthcare workers, first responders and COVID-19 essential personnel in Las Vegas and across the nation.

                                This is a short video where I asked my friend Nikko Guan to share her experiences with casual racism toward ethnic Asians at the beginning of the pandemic here in Melbourne, Australia. There was a lot of panic and misinformation surrounding the coronavirus, and a lot of people attributed the origin of the virus (Wuhan China) with the cause of the virus and harboured distrust toward anyone who looked remotely foreign or Asian. Some of my friends and acquaintances who were Asian but not even Chinese also reported similar experiences. It's especially pertinent as this also affected Asian diaspora who were born in Australia and may have never even been overseas, but are judged purely on their appearance. My friend in the interview had not been to China, or anywhere internationally, for many years. It's important that a global disaster that is the result of natural catastrophe isn't judged on malice for political or racial prejudices.",,,,,

                                While serving in the Texas Army National Guard on COVID-19 Relief Mission orders, I decided to apply to graduate school at St. Mary's University in San Antonio, TX. While on these orders, I ran into registration issues.



I was trying to register as a full time student with nine graduate credits, but St. Mary's had born forced to redo their entire Fall 2020 course scheduling due to COVID-19. This is described in detail in the email.



At first I asked the registrar: 

""I am trying to web register for a third course in the fall. When I go to register in Banner, it states ‚ÄúNo terms available for this option.‚Äù I seem to be in good standing and lack any registration holds that I can see. Is there any way to get my registration unlocked in Banner?""



They responded:

""We have temporarily closed registration so we can begin to make changes to the course schedule to accommodate the different modalities that will be offered.  We will reopen registration on August 3.  In the meantime, if you need to make a change to your schedule, I am happy to assist.  Let me know if I can help.""



I had to ask them to manually enter me for this course so that I was signed up for a full time course load in time to meet my funding date commitments. 



Luckily this situation was sorted out and I was able to attend St. Mary's University full time during Fall 2020. The Fall 2020 semester was interesting though, as St. Mary's as a whole went almost entirely online.",,,,,

                                I was offered a job at Arizona State University at the last minute. How last minute? I had already started teaching on campus in my previous position when I got the official offer. We moved to Tempe, AZ in the offseason. The rental market was full of pricey AirBnBs, but not a lot of homes for rent. I have two kids and a dog, so we set our sights on a house. I also wanted to be close to ASU, preferably walking distance, but I knew that was a big ask. We did, however, find a home. It‚Äôs walking distance to Rio Salado, downtown Tempe, and ASU. The catch is that it‚Äôs in the flight path for the Phoenix airport. When a plane flies overhead it sounds like a long, dull roar. It‚Äôs so loud you can‚Äôt hear yourself talk or talk to anyone around you (if you‚Äôre outside). Before COVID, the planes flew in and out of the airport like taxis. I counted how often they flew overhead, and it was about every 54 seconds for most of the day. Sometimes it felt so loud you didn‚Äôt want to sit outside. Post-March, however, everything has slowed way down. There are fewer planes, and that means we sit outside a lot more and enjoy our outside space.



I recorded the sound of a plane passing overhead while I hung up laundry to dry. It gives a sense of how long the sound takes over the area.",,,,,

                                Throughout my time curating and finding impacts of the pandemic named COVID-19 I have learned that through the many hardships that Americans have encountered over the past several months we are adaptable and resilient to change.  I have also learned that human beings ARE mostly generous and giving entities especially when faced with communal heartache.  Many of us have felt empathy at its finest by living in a difficult situation that is similar to the difficult situations that those around us are going through.  Through this collection, and through the collections of others, I have seen that people have deserted self-centered mentalities placing them with more understanding than ever before.  I look forward to seeing where these unselfish and positive mentalities take the humanity of our world.  

I have thoroughly enjoyed my work curating, archiving, creating oral histories and working as a team towards a common goal in this difficult time.  I look forward to refining these beginning skills I have acquired over the last 15 weeks by continuing to work in cyber archives, whether it be professionally or recreationally.  This experience has been unforgettable for me personally and professionally and I am proud to have been a part of saving this historic time in global history.

                                Like many people, I've been spending a lot more time in my back yard this year. Once the weather started getting nice enough our household and the neighbours all seemed to have the idea to start barbequing, just for something different to do, and we often had barbeques going in three back yards along at the same time. One such day I spotted two baby wattlebirds in the tree. I spent a good few hours that day, and the next few, just watching them and their parents feeding them, I even saw their first flight. It's something I never could have imagined spending so long doing before the pandemic, so I guess you could call that a positive of the experience. (HIST30060)",,,,,

                                I first heard about the A Journal of the Plague Year: An Archive of COVID-19 (JOTPY) internship opportunity through Arizona State University's History Master's Student's Facebook page. I decided to pursue my M.A. in history degree for a variety of reasons: I love learning, I love history, and I hoped to gain exposure to potential career opportunities. I chose to attend ASU because it was clear to me that the faculty prioritize community. When I saw Dr. Kole's Facebook post, I was instantly captivated. It was precisely the type of experience I was looking for without even knowing it. And it was an opportunity to work in real-time with ASU faculty and with other M.A. students, which created additional avenues to build community. I contacted my faculty advisor and decided to drop my upcoming courses to open up my schedule for this once in a lifetime experience.



Before JOTPY, I had very little knowledge of public history. As a high school educator, I have always believed in the importance and power of public history. Outside of teaching, however, I had no experience working in public history. My experience with JOTPY taught me that public history requires professionals to simultaneously use high-level critical thinking skills (i.e., how can we fill silences within the archive) and pay attention to details and minutiae (i.e., make sure that curator‚Äôs folksonomy terms are lowercase). One's ability to think ""big picture"" while not losing sight of the building blocks is crucial to the success of projects such as JOTPY. I have developed the ability to easily transition my thinking depending on the type of archival work that I am engaged in. Additionally, I have developed my ability to write in various modalities (i.e., blog posts, collection plans, press releases). I have fine-tuned working remotely, sharpened my problem-solving skills through innovative thinking, and learned a variety of new software ‚Äì from Omeka to Slack to otter.ai. I have also developed an understanding of ethics and best practices in public history. Although I am not sure in what capacity, I would like to continue to work within the field of public history.



As expected, the JOTPY internship was indeed a once in a lifetime experience. It felt good to do something for the very first time again. I felt challenged by the different types of writing we were asked to produce. Having never written a collection plan, a press release, or a blog post, each of those assignments pushed me outside of my comfort zone. As a result, I learned that I indeed do still love learning new things. Perhaps the most fulfilling aspect of this experience for me was working within my internship cohort. Our team's ability to directly communicate with each other, to offer constructive feedback, to step in to help others when needed, and to adapt to ever-constant changes characteristic of working in a rapid response live archive, was simply incredible. I also really enjoyed engaging with ASU faculty. Dr. Kole was an incredible leader whose guidance and support truly brought out the best in every single intern. She cultivated our strengths and presented opportunities for us to further develop our interests and passions while supporting the overall mission and work of JOTPY. I am not sure where I am headed next. However, I do know that by leaning into unique opportunities is something that I enjoy. I plan to continue to look for various ways to further develop myself academically, professionally, and personally. 



I developed the San Francisco Bay Area Collection as a way to ensure the diversity of the region was captured within the archive. One of the Collection's strengths is its ability to intersect with other major collections within JOTPY. While I do not have an official role within JOPTY, I plan to further develop the San Francisco Bay Area Collection through the curriculum I develop for my own students.",,,,,

                                It is my last year of undergraduate studies and a really crucial year for the transition into Medical School. Experiencing such a thing as this pandemic at such a momentous period in my life was intimidating at first but gradually transitioned into a much required reflection. The lockdown had started at the end of the Spring semester and the importance of school and studies started to fade away into what seemed like a never-ending holiday. The semester then ended and summer seemed like an extension of the holiday even though entrance exams were just around the corner for Medical School. Two months went by in a flash and nothing but a lazy attitude was accomplished. I then recieved this letter in an email from my grandfather who was half-way accross the world. The letter was a short story about his life and the educational aspects of it. He was clearly reliving some of his memories from when he was my age and wanted to impart some much needed advice onto me. Without knowing my mental state at that point, he knew exactly what I needed and could somehow sense my cowardice. His letter gave me a ""kick in the butt"", which was much required. From the letter; arose in me a certain kind of motivation that had escaped since the start of the lockdown. The letter is a small example highlighting the privilege of an education. It exemplifies the importance of learning, which can be useful for every student. The yearning to learn must never stop, especially at a time such as this.",,,,,

                                the Architecture studio spaces in the Annex building on the Wentworth campus, have been divided into cubicles. This was quite a change of scenery compared to the wide open space it used to be. The dividers give each student a cubicle of their own to do their work in safely. It has been hard to get used to, for the culture of studio here has always been one of collaborative work, checking in on a neighbor, and being able to be creatively influenced by peers. All of these things have unfortunately been put on hold by the virus. Once a lively, active space is now quite quiet and low key. I look to the future to be able to offer students after me the same great experiences I have been fortunate to have in this space when at its fullest potential with no barriers in sight. the use of all Covid protective measures being used in the CNC space over at the CfAR labs in the Wentworth Annex building on campus. PPE measures are very important to uphold in lab spaces where students have to collaborate with one another in order to successfully carry out their projects in the Architecture Department. These two students are seen wearing face masks, face shields as well as staying 6‚Äô apart in order to maintain safety regulations. It is important to follow these regulations in order to continue our collaborative work flow. It took some time to get used to and has given the students new challenges to face while trying to safely share ideas and drawings with one another as well as working together in the lab spaces. From leaning over desks to draw on the same paper, to sharing tools, most aspects of collaborative work in architecture school have had to be rewritten in order to keep each other and professors safe during these times.",,,,,

                                Beginning in mid-March I began working a minimum hour schedule in order to ensure that as few people as possible were in the office. We assumed the pandemic would blow over soon and that like with most other things the Department of Defense was just overreacting and rolling out guidance that would expire quickly. On April 20 it became apparent that this was not the case. The PDF seen here shows that this was not something that was done with a lack of care or critical thinking because stopping all DoD movement is not done lightly or easily. This order also began my additional two more months working from home or in my workplace with a severely cut back schedule. This stop movement also impacted my life by forcing me to stay in Germany for months longer than expected, as well as numerous friends and coworkers who were suddenly left with no way to leave the country after shipping all of their household goods or their vehicles. Essentially it through thousands of people into a state of instability that could only be rectified by the passing of time until the stop movement expired.",,,,,

                                My husband was exposed to COVID-19 by a co-worker from a different branch. She took the COVID-19 test, but instead of quarantining like you‚Äôre supposed to, she continued running errands. One of those errands was going to the bank, where my husband works and making a withdrawal. That same day she got her test results and called to let him know. OK, I feel a lot of things about that, annoyed. I‚Äôm really annoyed and frustrated that she believed she had COVID, went to the lengths to get tested, but didn‚Äôt self-quarantine. My husband is more empathetic. He thinks she had urgent things to do and no one to help her. OK, that‚Äôs the first part of this story. The second part, is that suddenly on FB I saw an advertisement for a research trial on COVID. I filled it out for my husband, and a few days later he got an email offering him the chance to participate in a study. I read the fine print, it seemed sketch. First, the trial is for 4,000 people to take Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that we know doesn‚Äôt work. Second, the compensation is only $300 total. That seems like a really, really low sum to be a guinea pig. Third, the way that the researchers phrased his options bothered me. 



On the consent form it lists his choices:

‚ÄúYour other options: There are currently no approved treatments to prevent infection or COVIF-19 symptoms for people who have had contact with an infected person. You do not have to participate in this study.



Your other choices may include:

‚Ä¢	Taking part in another study

‚Ä¢	Getting no PEP after contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.‚Äù



This seems far from neutral, and actually to me- sounds like a combination of pressure/fear to get people to participate. This is my first time seeing an informed consent form, and I wonder if they‚Äôre all this loaded in terms of trying to manipulate someone into donating their health and body to an experimental process.



The study was run by the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the University of Washington.

                                ‚ÄãWhen the covid-19 crisis began I was living in Bangkok, Thailand. My work visa was due to expire on April 7th and I had a flight to Australia booked on that date, but at the time the Australian Government was urging all citizens to return as quickly as possible because they feared that flights would be grounded. I called the Australian Embassy and asked what would happen if I became stranded without a valid visa and the man on the phone told me to change my flight to the next available one out, as things were changing by the minute and he couldn‚Äôt give me a certain answer.

‚ÄãOne option I considered was crossing the border to get a tourist visa, but then I saw on the news that many expats had crossed over into Laos to do just that, and had become stranded there because Thailand had suddenly closed its borders to all but its own citizens. Expats with homes, families, and jobs in Thailand were not allowed back into the country even though they‚Äôd acquired valid visas.

My flight on April the 7th was cancelled so I rebooked for March 31st. An announcement was made that all flights to Australia would cease on the 25th of March, so I cancelled that flight and managed to find another one on the 21st, which was on the following day. I had no time to pack up my apartment properly or get my affairs in order. I left my fianc√© in Bangkok thinking that I would be able to return to her in a month or so, but it‚Äôs now the end of August and it doesn‚Äôt seem as though Australia is going to let anyone out anytime soon.

Throughout the covid-19 crisis I have been documenting my experiences. The diary focuses on my trip to India in early March, where I nearly didn‚Äôt get out in time, as well as my escape from Bangkok and the everyday life in lockdown I‚Äôve been going through ever since. I send the entries to my fianc√© via email each week. My hope is that the diary will end with our reunion, but my fear is that life will lead us along a different path.

                                The ACLU of New Mexico joined forces with both local and international law firms to file a class-action lawsuit against the state of New Mexico. The lawsuit states that the state of New Mexico has failed to protect the lives and constitutional rights of people held in the correctional system.

                                These poems document the quarantine adjustment period: the first fifteen days. They are news reports, coping methods, and dreams. They reflect the terrifying and the mundane. I began this project on Twitter, aware that we were entering into what would be an important historical event, and assuming that this project would be what would keep me sane. Soon, cabin fever got to me and I lost my motivation, so I set them aside, hoping that they would eventually contribute to the growing body of pandemic literature. If I don't make it through this pandemic, please remember me through these poems.",,,,,

                                This piece brings to light the persistence in human ability to question authority. The ""tar cures"" of yesterday are scarily similar to the presidential suggestions to ""inject bleach"" today. To me, this piece brings a sense of comfort; just knowing that the people of 1918 had their share of pseudo-scientific authority figures to dodge and denounce just as we do in 2020.

                                This sums up what the beginning of the pandemic was like for me. I was bored as hell, and I just wanted to do something I thought would be a productive use of my time. So when I looked at the guitar in the corner of my room I figure I give it try. Besides, it was just collecting dust anyway. I feel like everyone was trying new things or new hobbies to make up for being inside for so long. Especially if you have a big family like me. The funny thing is that after about four weeks, I just stopped playing. I think I'll get back into it soon.

                                COVID-19 has affected several of my relationships and how I have stayed in contact with friends. I wanted to talk about how COVID-19 has changed my interactions with one of my friends, Angie. I have known Angie for several years but we became really close friends when we attended the same church congregation in Provo, Utah from 2015-2016. When I graduated from school in Spring 2018, I moved away from Provo for an internship and I haven‚Äôt lived in Provo since. Angie also graduated around the same time and she continued to work in the same area. 



Normally, Angie and I will visit one another every other month and get lunch or I would spend the weekend with her at her apartment. The last time I was with Angie before COVID-19 lockdown began was in February. I was staying with her for a weekend in Provo, Utah for a wedding. On February 7, we got Korean BBQ bowls and went to an art museum. The next morning we woke up early and got kolaches. And I was thinking we‚Äôd get together soon in another month or so.



For Angie‚Äôs birthday that same month, I sent her a sun hat because we made plans with our other two friends to go to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in June. But with the news of the onset of COVID-19 a few weeks later, we ended up canceling those plans. 



After a FaceTime call in April, we both figured out that we needed ways to stay connected while social-distancing safely. However, we didn‚Äôt have any new things to report because we were social-distancing. So we started our audiobook club to give ourselves something to chat about. So far we have listened and discussed The Only Plane in the Sky: An Oral History of 9/11, I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban, and White Fragility: Why It‚Äôs So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism. We are currently listening to Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood. Neither of us remembered who suggested our book club, but I‚Äôm glad we have stayed connected through it. Both Angie and I have enjoyed each of these books. They have made us much more knowledgeable about the world around us and I like discussing them with Angie. My favorite book we read together was White Fragility. We read it in response to the death of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. As white women, we realized we needed to better educate ourselves. We had a tough conversation, but I‚Äôm glad I had it with Angie who is incredibly compassionate and thoughtful.



Besides our book club, we have had video chats with some other friends and we‚Äôve texted one another. I finally saw Angie in person while she was passing through where I lived. We cautiously sat outside 6 feet apart and ate popsicles on my grass lawn. And I met her boyfriend for the first time!



The pandemic has changed how I connect with my friends. I rely much more on technology and scheduled calls. I have learned to cut myself and others some slack for this situation because there is so much more social friction than before. Weirdly enough,in some ways it has helped with my social anxiety because I don‚Äôt feel FOMO (a.k.a. The ‚Äúfear of missing out‚Äù). We‚Äôre all in the same crappy boat. The pandemic has also helped me think about why certain people are my friends. Now it‚Äôs less about proximity or someone‚Äôs availability but more so about someone‚Äôs loyalty, kind heart, or strong values.

It is a video of Crissy Field, the park and beach area near Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. It is a spot beloved by locals because of the open space and picturesque backdrop of the Bridge. The San Francisco Bay Area is experiencing an intense heat wave over Labor Day weekend. The heat, and the smoke from surrounding wildfires, has pushed residents from around the Bay Area to locations with cooler climates and cleaner air. While a number of local beaches are closed, it appears as if Crissy Field was not one of them. This video captures the crowds of people that flocked to Crissy Field over the Labor Day weekend.",,,,,

                                These rules have really altered the way the newsroom operates. It is significant because it shows how the operations of the office have had to change so that we all stay safe. Although we- the editors, pretty much all have our own computers we still share the space and desks. Typically we bounce from each other desks to help with one another speeds and ideas, but these practices have had to change. These changes have made it hard to have press weekend, but we still find ways to abide by these rules and put the paper together as a team.  Other clubs and groups on campus must also preform all their activities via Zoom, and cannot share a creative space. These rules epitomize the standards we all have to function under and still manage to get our goals completed.

Ever since then, we have had to wear a mask and stay 6 feet apart. Everything was boring because we weren't allowed to go outside.

Analysis of Spanish Flu Artifact 1918



	Between the years of 1917 to 1919, there was an outbreak of a mysterious, deadly flu. The outbreak occurred in 1917 unbeknownst to mankind, and the origin of the flu is still unknown, but has been named the Spanish Flu due to Spain‚Äôs explicit and early news coverage on it. The flu hit in two waves, and the wave that caused more casualties was through the fall and wintertime of the year 1918. Many countries were deeply affected by the flu, but not every country reported on it right away as it was undetected. China was one of many countries hit hard by the flu and believed to be the epicenter the 1918 Spanish Flu, but so was the U.S.; the origin is still unknown.

	On November 5, 1918, the China news outlet, The Shanghai Times, printed a newspaper with an article with coverage on Singapore‚Äôs President‚Äôs statement on the impact of the Spanish Flu. By this time more than 2,500 people had died from the flu in Singapore. In his statement, the president of Singapore explicitly said that the disease was fatal, but an individual could avoid catching it or passing it along by following these tips: avoid being in confined spaces, limit outdoor activities unless absolutely necessary, self-isolate and search for treatment if experiencing symptoms, and disinfecting homes daily. In this news coverage, the flu was not censored at all. The readers of the newspaper and the citizens of Singapore were clearly told about the flu and given clear and doable guidelines to follow to slow down the spread of the deadly disease.

Looking at the newspaper, it is most noticeable that it was printed in English although it was published in China. This leads one to believe the targeted audience were English speaking citizens, tourists, or even any U.S. soldiers who may have been in China due to the ongoing negotiations and aftermath of World War I. The U.S. had passed the Sedition Act in 1918 that limited and censored what U.S. newspapers were reporting meanwhile news outlets in other countries like China and Singapore were letting their citizens know more explicitly of the disease that seemed to be killing people. In 1918, U.S. citizens were merely given suggestions and remedies on how to handle the flu. The ongoing war efforts were more important to the U.S. president than the health of the people. 

The Spanish Flu that occurred in 1918 is very similar to the pandemic that is infecting and killing people now: COVID-19. The similarities between the two is that there is no vaccine, practicing social distancing and cleanliness is important, and businesses and schools have been shut down to prevent the spread of the flu. Just as how 1918 President Woodrow Wilson was suspected to have caught the Spanish Flu, today‚Äôs President, Donald Trump, was confirmed to have caught COVID-19 and recovered from it. This pandemic seems to be a repeat of history because President Trump seems to prioritize travelling in a time when staying home is important just as President Wilson made the decision to travel to France to come up with a solution to World War I. Because the tips from the president of Singapore on the Spanish flu are identical to the guidelines set in place for the 2020 pandemic, I believe that the world today will survive the pandemic just like society did after 1918 as long as we keep these safety measures in place.",,,,,

‚ÄúA lot of times, when they come to us, it's kind of the last stop. They have no other place to go when they're looking for how to get a driver's license or get medical benefits,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe don't turn anyone away.‚Äù

The 3-year-old organization, led by refugees and immigrants, aims to help those same populations become self-sufficient after their arrival in the United States.

RICE provides employment and housing assistance, English classes, dental care and help navigating the immigration and education systems.

Those services have become even more vital during the COVID-19 pandemic, Braham said: As the virus forced many other community organizations to operate remotely, RICE has kept its doors open.

‚ÄúOther organizations have cut their hours or gone virtual, and families may not be able to get on with virtual meetings if they don‚Äôt have internet access,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo, they come to us. We've taken a lot more families in.‚Äù

In an interview with the Luce Foundation‚Äôs Southwest Stories project, Braham discussed the additional hurdles COVID-19 has created for refugee communities and how RICE is responding.",,,,,

                                I chose to submit a few tweets that go along with the exhaustive perspective I‚Äôve had on the pandemic since we first were asked to quarantine back in March. As someone who works in customer service and interacts with people all day, I was immediately on board with social distancing, mask wearing, and limiting being in public spaces. However, it became very clear that this was not everyone‚Äôs opinion of COVID-19. 

Seeing how large majorities of people are so against measures put in place to protect us has been quite frustrating to witness. The lack of empathy toward those who have been negatively affected by the pandemic (such as family deaths, irreversible health issues, loss of jobs, etc.) has done nothing but increased, as people on one side continue to believe all of it is a hoax and being blow out of proportion. How is it dramatic when 200,000 people, and counting, have died? How is it a hoax when it‚Äôs still running rampant through our country but other countries managed to get it under control by actually taking steps to do so? Hearing the excuses that we shouldn‚Äôt let ourselves be dominated by the virus is incredibly irritating, when we shouldn‚Äôt resign ourselves to living with something that could be of great harm to us or others in our lives. We should be trying to eradicate it as much as possible. Alas, my efforts are fruitless.

On top of that, seeing the dichotomy of the pandemic with the protests for BLM and such side by side has been an interesting spectacle. BLM protestors have made sure to protest safely and because of it, they have yet to turn into super-spreader events. In addition, the hypocritical outlook on police brutality is puzzling. They say the black and brown men killed by police should have just complied or else they wouldn‚Äôt have been killed, yet these are the same people refusing to wear masks because it is their right? It was those men‚Äôs rights to just exist and you think they deserved to die because of it? The privilege of it all is absolutely baffling. Those who don‚Äôt want to wear masks believe it is their right to protest it, then turn around and scream profanities and spew hate at those protesting with Black Lives Matter. You can‚Äôt demand justice for your minor inconvenience yet hope to tear down the efforts of those fighting for a real cause. Your rights are the same rights as others.

Overall, the past six months have been eye-opening to say the least. Our country has never been more divided: socially, politically, economically, or financially. The fact that we aren‚Äôt all on the same page about taking care of each other, having empathy, and wanting everyone to thrive and live is so mind-boggling when these things are basic human decency. My heart hurts reading every news story that comes out each day, knowing that we continue to push farther and farther away from one another, when really we should be striving for a better goal. I can only hope that 2021 holds better times for us, but things appear bleaker than ever.

                                This image is significant for me because watching this event play out hundreds of times over the past few months has shown me just how impactful the virus has been on different segments of people within our greater population. Most people grow furious at the realization that they forgot their mask in the car, expressing frustration in their body language. On the opposite extreme, many have conformed to mask laws quite well, accepting their necessity and even sporting colorful masks with fun designs. No matter how one feels about them, seeing masks everyday reminds us of the pandemic situation we‚Äôre in, and just how real it is.",,,,,

                                I wrote this article for my internship and I've always wanted to see it published given that it gives us a perspective of a health care worker that became a patient for coronavirus. In the months that the Philippines has been on lockdown and cases continue to rise up, it's very telling that those who are vulnerable to the virus still aren't secured and compensated for the work they have done so far.

                                This story is very significant for me as its something that I never thought i would have lived, a pandemic. I was very lucky of passing this past six months in my home with my family where I have learned to value everything a lot I spend most of the time in my home. What I have uploaded is a video from a very recognized mountain called el Avila which happens to be my every morning view from my balcony. El Avila represents protection to our city, the same way the mask is protection for us in these very critical moments.

                                Working During a Pandemic is Fun

In late March both of my part time jobs closed down. I have two contrasting occupations. One is at a Worldwide cooperation. The other is a small, locally owned business. I‚Äôve felt the effects of the pandemic most forcefully while at work. Before the pandemic, I was working 60 hours weeks to support myself and go to school. I did not go anywhere else but work and home. The bars, salons, and other recreational areas shutting down had little to no effect on my day to day life. This is a cross correlation of the similarities and differences of the issues I have run into while working through the pandemic. 

At the beginning of the shutdown, my corporate job surprised me with increased wages and benefits to help aid through the initial closings. At my corporate job I was considered an essential employee, but my particular store did not have a drive through. I was able to stay safe at home for four weeks while the company shipped in barriers and masks and other COVID equipment. 

My other occupation at the small business, as a swim instructor for children shut down immediately and opted to put their employees on furlough until we were allowed to open back up. Because I already worked one part time job, I did not receive much unemployment benefit. Through no fault of my own, my income was cut in half and my savings are, to this day, empty. Even with the temporary pay raise given to me by the corporate job, rent and my 3,000 dollar tuition made my expenditure even to my income. 

When I went back to work at my essential job, which was making coffee, there were a lot of new rules to keep up with and enforce on customers. On my first day back a lady threw a handful of rocks at our window because we did not allow her to sit down at the facility. Many, many more occasions like this happened on a daily basis. People were frustrated with the new rules and unclear on their necessity. Customers were not required to wear a mask in the facility until very recently. This was very frustrating. If only one part of the party is wearing a mask no one is protected. It felt useless to be wearing something that was only designated to make customers feel better without risking their own comfort. The pandemic started affecting Butte county at a dangerous level in May, but people were not required to wear masks in public until four months later. Around mid July is when the Governor issued a State wide mask regulation and we were finally allowed by the company to ask customers to comply. 

Even with the statewide mask regulation, and every single business requiring it, customers continue to yell, demean me and blatantly not follow the rule. Every time a customer comes in without a mask I get extremely anxious at how they are going to respond to me politely asking if they have one. My company is even allowing me to give our mask supply to customers without one, for free! Even when offered a free mask, I am turned down and shamed. On this occasion I have to politely reply that I can walk their beverage to them and they can wait outside the store without a mask. If even one person is not wearing a mask, they are spreading their germs and infecting the entire room. If they are contagious or asymptomatic, COVID droplets can live on clothes, and services for up to three hours. It can reach your eyes and infect you that way. If you go to the Doctors office you will see them wearing a mask and face shield for this very reason.

     My finance, whom I live with, is immunocompromised. He has had bronchitis twelve times in his 21 year lifetime. This is due to being exposed to mildew and mold in his formative years creating a deadly combination of asthma and a severe dust allergy. If he was to catch COVID-19, he would become fatally ill and possibly die. This thought is on the forefront of my mind everyday at work. I am becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of knowledge and leadership in the Trump Administration during the Pandemic. It is now 5 months since we first started practicing half hearted health regulations. We are at 1,500 American deaths a day. Our death to population ratio is shameful compared to other countries. We have mass graves being dug on an island in New York for the unnamed victims of COVID-19. This is affecting our prison populations, our urban and rural communities. No one is safe. We have very simple precautions to follow but the constant negation of the validity of these practices from our president has left most of the population under a false sense of security.  I have begun to resent customers I once enjoyed chatting with, due to their constant apprehension of wearing a mask.

My other job, as a swim instructor, opened up June 17, about three months after my job as a barista did. This came with the forced opening of the economy. Within the first two weeks of being open, three teachers had to be tested and put into a two week quarantine.However, due to constant sanitation and all employees wearing masks, the spread stopped there. At this job, masks are required or no service is given. All staff and teachers wear masks at all times, and the building and equipment is decontaminated every night. Even with this constant sanitation, you can‚Äôt control people‚Äôs personal lives. As time goes on people are becoming more restless. When the president claims he does not believe in masks, and holds rally not servicing personal distance or masks, the populace feels safe to socially fraternize. Many of my coworkers are holding small gatherings, drinking with acquaintances and risking contamination through ignorance. 

The customers of this job are a lot more understanding. We make it abundantly clear what is required of them and we will not give them service otherwise. These clear boundaries, ultimately, are what ensure proper cooperation. We called every single client personally before we reopened and confirmed the new rules. We sent out emails, we have signs posted and every employee is specially trained on how to facilitate the new rules. I believe these regulations reflect how the populace responds to strong leadership. If we had clear rules from the beginning, with strict boundaries, would this second wave of infection have spread?

                                ‚ÄúMorning Routine‚Äù is an ad I created about Covid-19.  The reason I chose this medium is that many advertisements on the internet and TV are related to the virus. ‚ÄúMorning Routine‚Äù is about my brother's routine and how he gets ready in the morning. It seems like a normal routine like everyone else which is to wake up, brush your teeth, put on clothes, put your shoes on and go out to the rest of their day. In the end, it shows a close of him putting on a mask. In the news, there is a lot of talk about when normal is coming back. Countries all over the world were under lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. In Minnesota, the confirmed cases are not as extreme other states like New York. My personal experience with Covid-19 is doing my part of trying to make things better. In my family, many are nurses so are making sacrifices and working hard. I am still in college trying to become a nurse so staying home is doing my part to make their job easier. On social media, many of my peers and others are complaining about when all of this will be over. People are going out acting like life is normal by hanging with friends without social distancing and not wearing masks. As time goes by, many countries are now easing lockdown trying to bring up the economy against, but the consequences are increasing the chance of the virus spreading more. Although I try to stay home as much as possible, I have uncles and aunts that are getting older and are at a higher risk by the coronavirus so I grocery shop for them every week and deliver them. When I go to grocery stores, I get very anxious because many people are not wearing masks. I don‚Äôt want to be the one responsible for getting corona and getting my family sick. The coronavirus is going to stay and be here for a while until a vaccine is found and produced on a 

large scale. This in my opinion is the new normal because I don‚Äôt think we will ever go back to normal. This pandemic has and will keep changing the way we live in the future.",,,,,

                                I've chosen to submit this interview, because it captures the raw and real experience of an (almost) brand new teacher. Someone who has recently graduated (May, 2019) and barely dipped their toes into the teaching world. She has had to adapt to not only teaching a subject different than the one she studied for in college, but also navigating the trials of teaching in a pandemic world. 



This 40 minute long interview that show cases the emotions and trials that a teacher has to experience. On top of issues like student engagement, and teaching unfamiliar material she has to ensure that she's accounting for all her students attending, both the ones physically and online, while juggling asynchronous and synchronous classes. One particular poignant quote ""It's not that I'm trying to relax and be happy or anything. It's just trying to find downtime to just have energy"" really sums up the energy of how the year has gone for this new teacher. 



This perspective is important, as it shows the reality of how strenuous the pandemic education scene has been for educators, and the problems it's creating for students, as this person discusses. The pitfalls of technology that are harming rather than helping, and causing issues that might reverberate in the futures of the student's academic careers.",,,,,

                                Local resident Genelle Richey retired in 2012, dedicating 62 years of her life to teaching the youth of Blanchard, Oklahoma. Since then, Mrs. Richey's status of being a local educator and mentor as only grown in appreciation. On April 11, 2020 during the peak of COVID-19 shutdowns, the community of Blanchard expressed its gratitude to Mrs. Richey by organizing hundreds of participants to drive past her in a ""reverse"" parade celebrating her 90th birthday. She and her family gathered on North Main Street to greet the cheerful crowd as they passed. The event was organized by her family and mostly through Facebook to preserve the surprise to Mrs. Richey herself. The event took place between 3:00 and 4:00 PM on that Saturday, April 11. The parade featured vehicles displaying signs and decorated ""float"" style trailers. The line of vehicles were led by Blanchard Police and Fire Departments. Parade vehicles dropped off birthday gifts and took photographs to preserve the special event. During an otherwise quiet and uneventful month of pandemic closures, the community of Blanchard resiliently came together to adapt a memorable day for a very special woman.

Connections (August 2020) is a newsletter edited by Viv Parry for the Child Survivors of the Holocaust  (CSH) Melbourne Group. In this newsletter there are 9 individual contributions from CSH in answer to her personal request to ""tell us how you are travelling at the moment during this unprecedented time?"" Viv made no suggestions, asking only that they addressed the group (265 CSH members) and shared their thoughts at whatever level they found personally relevant to themselves.



'Child Survivors, Corona' is an article written by Dr Paul Valant's for Connections, published in April 2020. A second article on the topic appears in the August edition of the newsletter.  

 

An email from Stefanie Selzer, dated 31.7.2020. Stefanie is the World Federation Of Jewish Child Survivors of the Holocaust & Descendants  N.Y, President and Claims Conference representative.  Stefanie forwarded our Connections Newsletter to the other CSH groups in the US including Canada where Mark Elster felt compelled to reply (also included in the same document).



These documents together create a story of a unique group of people who are supporting each other at this difficult time, with a remarkably positive attitude.

                                This year has been a difficult year for myself. I have had to endure many uncertainties in my personal life such as the loss of a very close friend due to suicide and the practice of my  religion has been something that has helped me to cope with depression and despair but the practice of religion has been something difficult to do during this time that requires social distancing. I thought I could perhaps contribute my personal feelings and emotions as it relates to the practice of religion in the everyday world of a person during this moment in time.

                                This document is a list of requirements and guidelines for the attendance of a an acting workshop I was a part of in October of this year, as a part of a larger project the Drama Department at my university, St. Mary's was and is attempting to create a new and safer theatre experience for the coming semesters. The workshop we attended was, of course, created with the intent for attendees to participate in-person. Despite this, however, as the requirements here show, the fact that that was impossible, or at least very ill-advised, not only wasn't enough to prevent it from happening, it may have helped it in a good number of ways. For a first example, the individuals in charge of the workshop, affiliated with The Tectonic Theatre, were situated in New York, as opposed to my university being located in San Antonio Texas. The fact that the workshop was held virtually actually made it much more realistically approachable as otherwise the distance would have complicated matters considerably, which was taken care of in that way. In the same vein, as the requirements hint at with the items that are required, is that each person who participated was able to use their surroundings, almost exclusively their own homes, which they were of course very familiar with, to great affect for the exercises that were given to them. In fact, despite the initial misgivings that many of us-myself included-initially had, the workshop was able to take place not only just as well as it would have had it been in person, but in my personal opinion, it might have gone even better. All in all, the workshop was a pretty impressive look at overcoming complications from this pandemic and working around them to make the virtual experience lose nothing from an in-person experience.",,,,,

                                I decided to attend St. Mary's University while on the COVID-19 relief mission with the Texas Army National Guard during Summer 2020. The attached email is the email I received when I was notified that I had earned a scholarship that would lower my costs of attending graduate school. I was overwhelmed.



I applied to the scholarship with the following essay:



I am currently a graduate student completing my Graduate Certificate for Dual Credit Teaching in U.S. History. I am on track to graduate in May 2021. 



I work as an Anthropology Instructor at Blinn College. I currently serve as the Anthropology Instructor to RELLIS Campus for the joint Texas A&M Engineering at Blinn Program. Students are co-enrolled in the College of Engineering at Texas A&M University and Blinn College. Given the expansion of the Blinn RELLIS Campus, there is a need for instructors who are certified to teach in multiple disciplines. Though my Ph.D. is in Anthropology, I possess a B.A. in History. I decided to go back to school in order to become certified to teach History courses so that I could further advance Blinn‚Äôs vision for the RELLIS Campus. 



	I have a proven track record of academic excellence that I intend to continue at St. Mary‚Äôs University. I finished my undergraduate studies and previous graduate studies with GPA‚Äôs over 3.90, receiving various awards along the way (see C.V. for details). 



	The most important thing in my life is not my job or academic achievement, but my family. I am married to a loving and supportive wife, Helen, who works as a high school math teacher. We have two amazing daughters ‚Äì three-year-old Annie and one-year-old Rose. Though difficult, I have decided to surrender some of my limited time with them in order commit to and finish this graduate certificate online by May 2021. 



	Finally, in addition to my work at Blinn College and my family obligations, I serve as a Commissioned Officer in an Airborne Company with the Texas Army National Guard. Most recently I was activated for the COVID-19 Relief Mission, leaving my wife behind with the children. My orders ran from 18 April-18 July. While on this mission, I initially served as a COVID-19 Mobile Testing Team (MTT) Officer-in-Charge (OIC). Subsequently promoted to 2nd-in-Charge/Executive Officer (2IC/XO) of Texas Region 6, I led a staff of 18 Soldiers in personnel management and logistical resupply for 12 MTTs, encompassing 229 Soldiers and Airman. In all, my region served 8.2 million people in 25 counties - 29% of Texas. Working with multiple civilian agencies, including the Texas Department of Emergency Management, Texas Emergency Management Task Force, and Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service, I managed the resupply of 546,825 medical supply items and the testing of 58,550 COVID-19 patients at nursing homes, assisted living centers, meat packaging plants, drive-through sites, and walk-up sites in the region.



	Thank you for making this scholarship fund available to non-traditional students like myself. Additional funding would significantly lighten the overall family burden of completing this graduate program. Thank you once again for your generosity. 



It was very uplifting that my hard work with the military also allowed me to attend school full time upon returning from duty.",,,,,

                                The pandemic has taken away different things for different people. In my case, it took away what I was working towards during my gap year between high school and college. It sent me into a state of depression and panic as I no longer had a clear view of what my future looked like. Instead of giving up, I researched my other options and became confident in the new plan I set in stone for myself. Things will never go as planned in life, and it is hard to be prepared for the curveballs that are thrown your way, but as long as you carry hope and trust in yourself, you can always find a way.

                                A wonderful group of students from my first year of teaching (2011-12) has stayed in touch since they graduated in 2015. They have an annual tradition of coming back to the Bay Area at least once per year and spending the day in San Francisco. They take a photograph in front of the Golden Gate Bridge - even if it is completely covered in fog - to mark their time together. The COVID-19 pandemic made their tradition impossible this year. They still decided to mark the year by creating this ""Greeting from...San Francisco"" postcard style photoshopped image. It is such a sign of the times! I am grateful that the group is finding a way to stay connected during the COVID-19 pandemic.",,,,,

                                This photo is important to me because it shows how having to be at home forced me to communicate with my loved ones in different ways. I think the photo also represents a strengthened relationship between my boyfriend and I and my sister and I, and how the three of us became friends.

                                Using autoethnography as the method of research, this paper explores the fears and anxieties exacerbated in the Latinx community during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through narrative snapshots, I depict how the pandemic worsened due to policy meant to limit undocumented Latinx immigrants‚Äô access to health services. By focusing on the evolution of the public charge, this project depicts the ways the Trump administration‚Äôs hateful rhetoric and racist policies exacerbate the fear, life-threatening conditions, and long-lasting trauma on undocumented Latinx immigrants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Closing in on one Brooklyn family‚Äôs navigation of the 2020 political climate, worsening pandemic, working-class realities, and immigration system, I take you through the present realities often left unseen by mainstream media.

                                During Spring of 2020, I was wearing many hats. I was a 1st Lieutenant in the Texas Army National Guard, a husband, a father of two girls, a PhD student, a research assistant for the department chair of the Texas A&M Anthropology Department, and an Anthropology Instructor at Blinn College.  Everything changed on April 17th, 2020 when I was activated with the National Guard on 45 day orders starting at 0800 on April 18th. 



I packed my bags, told my kids and wife goodbye, and sent emails to my supervisors at Blinn College and Texas A&M University. Two of the emails featured here are the emails that I sent to my supervisors. 



My orders were initially for 45 days but were later extended to 93 days in total. I sent updates to my supervisors as I learned new information. One update email to Dr. De Ruiter at Texas A&M University is featured in this email collection as well. 



This is my third activation with the National Guard in the past three years. I have been called to floods, hurricanes, and now a pandemic. Serving the people of the State of Texas is never boring, but it can be difficult on the family and jobs that I leave behind. I hope these emails speak to that struggle.",,,,,

Before the pandemic, we were only allowed to work in-person while on campus.

Being able to still work on the projects that we are assigned during this pandemic is a nice escape from reality.",,,,,

                                I am a server at a Chili's in Tempe Arizona. Covid has changed many things about my day to day life and work. The restaurant scene has changed a lot as well. This recording was from the restaurant on a Friday night about 30 minutes before closing at midnight. Pre-Covid I would be cleaning tables and finishing up some cleaning to get out of there but as you can hear, the place was still buzzing. Since Covid began numerous bars and late night establishments have closed and thus Chili's a relatively safe chain restaurant that was able to withstand closure has taken some of that business in Tempe. Peoples normal dining cycles seem to have also changed a bit and becoming more random. Normal lunch and dinner times matter less when everyone is working from home and night outs with friends are more rare.

                                Kyle Ballard is active duty military in North Augusta, South Carolina. Kyle identifies as a gay man and uses the pronouns he and him. He has witnessed firsthand the federal government response to the pandemic as he works on a military base and was given a restriction of movement order after falling ill in March. Despite his illness, he was unable to get a Covid-19 test due to testing restriction at the time. He spends most of his time working at the military base and developing student government for Arizona State University‚Äôs online campus. Kyle discusses the potential issues faced particularly by LGBTQ+ youth in the middle of the pandemic and his disappointment in the government response across all levels. He lives with his boyfriend Mason and recounts how it was difficult to not see him as much after the quarantine had ended. Kyle wishes the media would focus more on what other countries have done to successfully limit the spread of Covid-19.

He discusses the transition to online learning in schools as he is head of the science department and a teacher at a high school in Red Deer, Alberta. He also shares his concerns for the planned return to school. Jason runs a science podcast as well as a popular twitter account for his dog ""Bunsen Berner"" which he uses to share scientific facts, research, and methods in a fun way. As such he discusses the ""blowback"" by members of the public on social media to scientists when it shares information regarding the virus and pandemic.",,,,,

                                This graph illustrates unfortunately the differences in the handling of the Pandemic.  When I created this I chose six industrialized nations They have a total of 346 million residents, according to Google. Also according to Google the United States has a population of 331 million residents. Five of the six nations appear on the graph below  the  figure for the United States. Taiwan did not have enough cases despite a population of 23.5 million to register on  the bottom of the graph. So that is six industrialized nations for 77 thousand deaths versus 200 thousand deaths in the United States alone and growing at the world's fastest rate of infection.  This is important to me because it illustrates the failure of our government to take the Pandemic seriously enough.",,,,,

                                The object is an email from St. Mary's University President Thomas Mengler recognized Juneteenth stating that campus will be closed that Friday, June 19th, 2020, for prayer and reflection on racial justice and racism in the U.S. In the email, President Mengler acknowledges the murder of George Floyd to reflect on during the summer of mass protests and the Black Lives Matter movement. The campus community is also called to action with upcoming initiatives to create an ""anti-racist"" university. Dialogue and action are said to occur and relate to the Mariniast belief and tradition to act for the common good. 



The email represents a significant time within our pandemic year, which was the death of George Floyd that influenced mass protests and greater momentum for the existing Black Lives Matter, demanding the police be defunded. The email portrays how St.Mary's as an institution has reflected on the national issue and its influence on Marianist culture and call to action.

So far, they have not swayed officials... but in November, voters will have a chnace to decide whether certain non-violent offenders should be able to earn time off their sentences.

                                I was an associate editor for our student magazine ""The Lakelander"" at Lakeland Community College. I became infected by Covid-19 on March 23, 2020, two months before I was to graduate with honors from the school. Our student staff gathered on-line to talk about our final magazine for the school year and we asked everyone to write about their experience with the pandemic. This was my submission.

                                this essay was about if America was living up to its values of freedom and equality as well as states rights and if they should be allowed to impede on one's freedoms. i used parts of the BLM protests and deaths like George Floyd to show that America is not truly equal and that there are still things that need to be changed before equality is achieved. For states rights i put the states trying to restrict abortion and women's rights.",,,,,

This is achieved through secure and reliable fortnightly catch ups, between the buddy and participant for up to a period of a year. Together with group sessions,‚ÄØthe participants and buddies come together and are involved in activities that enhance their mindset and promote their curiosity, resilience and autonomy. 

Due‚ÄØto‚ÄØCOVID-19, NCJWA Vic took steps to adapt the Jam Project in this difficult time.‚ÄØOur priority is to‚ÄØmaintain our objectives and values‚ÄØthrough these adaptations.",,,,,

                                The Journal of the Plague Year will become a lasting memory and not just because it is preserved inside of an archive. One of the most memorable aspects will be the way our internship class grew to become a team. As we all look back to our first weeks, little did we know the scope of pedagogy we would need to experience before arriving upon these final days. Dr. Kole gave us the support we needed, but wasn‚Äôt afraid to introduce us to the ‚Äúrapid‚Äù nature of a rapid response archive. The conversations of ‚Äúwearing hats‚Äù became common terminology to describe all of the evolving jobs this internship would entail. Some days we were scholars thinking deeply about the concerns of silences. Other days we felt more like roving reporters gathering stories as they were developing. Our ‚Äúmarketing hats‚Äù were often in use as we promoted our Calls for Submissions. Undoubtedly, there were days we were required to stack our hats four high. As fledgling public historians, we accomplished all of these things and we did it together as a team. The word ‚Äúteam‚Äù seems the most obvious description, but for our group the most fitting term is ‚Äúfamily.‚Äù



	This moment has already come and gone, yet it‚Äôs preserved for those that look toward it. I felt the need to devote my individual time to preserving those things that were at propinquity. That being said, the ‚ÄúRural Voices‚Äù collection is something near and dear to me. Near because I live in the community that inspired this collection. Dear because it‚Äôs so much more; it‚Äôs home. I created it because of this familiarity, a familiarity that was disrupted by COVID-19 and I experienced firsthand. Moving forward, future interns will have the opportunity to continue what I have started. This collection was never meant to have only one voice and is only a reflection of its first voice. Every rural community has a wealth of history occurring and with each passing moment those voices fade. The ‚ÄúRural Voices‚Äù collection was, and should always remain, a direct response to that silence.",,,,,

                                For someone who is single, dating is a huge part of life and socialization. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed huge strain on this, begging the question, is it safe to date? First and foremost, the best advice is to do what is best for you, while taking into account the health and safety of others. If you are interested in dating during the pandemic, take the other person into account and see what they are most comfortable with. This could be as simple as wearing a mask if going out or having a date over zoom. The same ideology should be used when deciding on whether to be inanimate or not. Being safe is key, meaning dating in a pandemic is not impossible.",,,,,

                                My flu files project is about this article from the Boston Globe, published on September 17th, 1918, nearly 102 years ago and just as the Spanish Flu was starting to become a serious issue in the United States. While the disease was yet to wreak the havoc that would eventually ensue, the seriousness of the flu was already well known, especially around military installations where it originated and often spread. 

The author‚Äôs choice to open with the disclosure of the barber at the base being infected is actually quite clever, because it shows that not only is the flu spreading rapidly, but that people in specific positions being infected is exponentially more dangerous as they will be exposed to more people (and in the case of a barber be quite close to them) giving them more opportunities to spread the flu. 

It is very apparent how the article tries to prevent panic by slightly underselling the seriousness of the pandemic, stating nonchalantly that ‚ÄúIt was made known today that there are more than 3000 cases of Spanish Influenza at the base hospital now‚Äù. 3000 cases at a single military base is absolutely devastating but the article attempts to soften it in the next sentence by stating that ‚Äúnot all cases are serious‚Äù and ‚Äúthere is room at the hospital for 1500 more cases‚Äù. Even if that is true it is clear that the situation was already far from under control and obviously did not get much better from there. 

The article describes how the base has had to put a soft quarantine on the hospital and has repurposed an additional 12 wards of the hospital just for dealing with the flu. The section finally ends optimistically, stating that the flu has likely reached its zenith at the base. These attempts to distract or under exaggerate numbers of pandemics to prevent mass hysteria are unfortunately quite familiar to anyone who has been following more recent events, and in both cases many of them have been proven wrong.",,,,,

At the time this was published, there were no confirmed cases of the virus in the jails, but the Sheriff's office began increasing security and limiting access in an attempt to prevent the spread of the virus within the jail population. Even at the beginning, it was evident that this would not be a flash in the pan type incident but a long lasting event that would require rethinking the 'everyday normal' to keep people safe and healthy.",,,,,

                                I have been a fan of professional wrestling for years. It is a bit like watching a soap opera with elite athletes doing the occasional insane acrobatic stunt. While it may not technically be a sport, it can be very entertaining. Part of that entertainment is a raucous crowd cheering for their favorite wrestler or booing the antagonist. It is also when someone pulls off an Olympic level move and the crowd explodes. Now, there is no crowd. Due to COVID-19 the wrestlers no longer play to a live audience. To bring back some of the ambience missing from their absence, WWE (and some other forms of live entertainment) have instituted workarounds like digital fans on screens and fake crowd noise. Before that though, there was nothing. Just a complete absence of fans. Their silence was deafening and the events awkward. This is a recording of one such event, Smackdown, March 13, 2020. Two wrestlers, a referee, and three announcers all performing a play to no audience. There is a marked difference. WWE announcers are known for being loquacious, but in this their banter has an almost desperate edge to cover up the missing element of the fans. And not just the announcers. The referee and the wrestlers seem to be talking both more and louder. Even with all that there is still a very noticeable missing element of ambience. It is interesting to me how much they have to try to cover up the sound of silence.

                                The pandemic has been hard for all of us. Not all of us experience it the same exact way, but we all deal with similar themes such as: loneliness. I'm not the only person who had this experience, but maybe those who haven't tried this yet may take to the idea and have good results themselves. This story is important to me as it represents how humans adapt quickly and readily to the world around them in most cases. It also shows how being a social creature really allows us to ground ourselves to the world, to empathize and understand that which surrounds us: whether it be person or animal. This story really puts in perspective the idea that we may all be home, social distancing, but we are never truly cut off from the world, and people, around us.",,,,,

                                Why is it so hard for me to say goodbye to this group of interns? I‚Äôve taught face-to-face classes, I‚Äôve taught online, and I‚Äôve never had this reaction at the end of a class. HST580: Professional Experience is done. Normally this is the point where I turn in grades and post a meme or giphy about grading. But I didn‚Äôt do that, because I don‚Äôt want to want to look at their portfolios and I don‚Äôt want to read their last journal entries. When I do that, it‚Äôs really over. The oh so experimental 15 week internship completed remotely and asynchronously proved to be one of the most fulfilling experiences of my higher ed teaching career. 



Today, as the dust began to settle after their last meeting, I asked myself. What is the big deal? Why did you cry (again) when saying goodbye to this group of students on Zoom? I think there are a lot of factors at play. One is that we all took a crash course on rapid response archives together. I had barely a hair and sometimes no more expertise than the interns, and their critical analysis of curation, best practices, and ethics helped the team solve problems in real time. Second, although I love teaching online, like many I‚Äôve felt very isolated with the shelter in place rules. Even though I have a wonderful family and a less than wonderful dog, I looked forward to our weekly meetings quite earnestly. It felt like my one or two moments of the week that I got to connect with people and talk about really interesting things, even if sometimes I was just venting. We all got to vent. We vented about the pandemic‚Äôs effect on our mental health, the almost overwhelming feeling some days that we just can‚Äôt stand it anymore, and the frustration that it feels like things aren‚Äôt getting better and normal is so ephemeral we fear we might never know it again. Third is that the interns were true to themselves and authentic. No two were exactly the same, but they were willing to push themselves and evolve with a constantly moving target.  What more can one ask for than to work with genuine people, who took on a huge project and found the path of collaboration instead of competition.



Today‚Äôs meeting culminated in a recorded conversation with a representative from CBS. Potentially, some of the conversation could wind up the program ‚Äú60 Minutes.‚Äù The conversation was so rich, diverse, and truly heartwarming that the entire meeting needs to be a part of the archive. I wouldn‚Äôt trade this experience for anything, and I feel so lucky to have worked with such an incredible team.",,,,,
